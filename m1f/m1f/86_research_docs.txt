# m1f-research Documentation

> ⚠️ **Early Alpha Warning**: m1f-research is in early alpha and under heavy development. Expect significant changes to features, APIs, and workflows.

AI-powered research orchestrator that automates the entire workflow from finding sources to creating Claude-ready knowledge bundles.

## What is m1f-research?

While the m1f toolkit provides individual tools (m1f-scrape, m1f-html2md, m1f), **m1f-research orchestrates them all** into an intelligent research pipeline:

1. **AI finds sources** on any topic (using Claude/Gemini)
2. **You review and curate** the URLs (unlike black-box LLM research modes)
3. **Automatically processes** everything: scrape → convert → bundle
4. **Creates knowledge bundles** ready for Claude's Project Knowledge

**Key advantage**: Unlike LLM "research modes", YOU control which sources are used and can add your own trusted sources.

## 🚀 New: 7-Phase Workflow System

The m1f-research tool now features an advanced workflow system that transforms simple queries into comprehensive research:

1. **Query Expansion** - Automatically generate search variations
2. **URL Collection** - Gather URLs from multiple sources  
3. **Interactive Review** - Curate URLs before scraping
4. **Deep Crawling** - Follow links for comprehensive coverage
5. **Smart Bundling** - Organize content intelligently
6. **AI Analysis** - Generate insights and summaries
7. **Phase Management** - Resume from any phase

## Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Use more URLs initially, let analysis filter
2. **Use templates**: Match template to your research goal
3. **Interactive mode**: Great for exploratory research
4. **Combine with m1f**: Feed research bundles into m1f for AI analysis

## Troubleshooting

### No API Key

```
Error: API key not set for ClaudeProvider
```

Solution: Set environment variable or pass in config

### Rate Limiting

```
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
```

Solution: Reduce `--concurrent` or increase timeout range

### Low Quality Results

- Increase `--urls` for more options
- Adjust `relevance_threshold` in config
- Try different `--template`

## Database Architecture

### Main Database (research_jobs.db)

Tracks all research jobs:

- Job ID, query, status, timestamps
- Configuration used
- Statistics (URLs found, scraped, analyzed)

### Per-Job Database (research.db)

Tracks job-specific data:

- URLs (source, status, checksums)
- Content (markdown, metadata)
- Analysis results (scores, key points)

### Smart Delay Management

The scraper implements intelligent per-host delays:

- No delay for first 3 requests to a host
- Random 1-3 second delay after threshold
- Allows fast parallel scraping of different hosts

## Future Features

# m1f-research

AI-powered research tool that orchestrates the entire research workflow: from finding sources to creating AI-ready knowledge bundles.

## The Big Picture: Why m1f-research?

The m1f toolkit already provides powerful individual tools:
- **m1f-scrape**: Scrapes websites and downloads content
- **m1f-html2md**: Converts HTML to clean Markdown
- **m1f**: Bundles files for AI consumption

**m1f-research takes this further by automating the entire research workflow:**

1. **AI-Powered Discovery**: Instead of manually finding URLs, m1f-research uses AI (like Claude) to search for relevant sources on any topic
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Review and curate the discovered URLs before scraping
3. **Automated Pipeline**: Automatically scrapes approved URLs, converts to Markdown, and creates bundles
4. **AI-Ready Output**: Produces research bundles perfect for uploading to Claude's Project Knowledge or other AI tools

Think of it as your automated research assistant that:
- Takes a topic (e.g., "microservices best practices")
- Asks AI to find the best sources
- Lets you review what it found
- Downloads and processes everything
- Creates a knowledge bundle ready for AI analysis

### Key Advantage Over LLM "Research Mode"

**The crucial difference from built-in LLM research modes:** 
- **You control the sources**: Review and prioritize which URLs to include
- **Custom curation**: Remove low-quality or irrelevant sources before processing
- **Add your own sources**: Include specific URLs you trust
- **Persistent knowledge**: Create reusable knowledge bundles for your projects
- **No black box**: You see exactly what content goes into your research

## Overview

m1f-research orchestrates the complete research pipeline by intelligently combining all m1f tools:

- **Discovers** relevant URLs using AI (instead of manual searching)
- **Reviews** URLs with optional human curation
- **Scrapes** approved content using m1f-scrape
- **Converts** HTML to Markdown using m1f-html2md
- **Bundles** everything using m1f for AI consumption
- **Analyzes** content to extract key insights

### 7-Phase Workflow System

m1f-research implements a sophisticated workflow system that breaks research into 7 distinct phases:

1. **INITIALIZATION** - Setup and configuration validation
2. **QUERY_EXPANSION** - Generate multiple search query variations for comprehensive coverage
3. **URL_COLLECTION** - Search for relevant URLs using expanded queries
4. **URL_REVIEW** - Optional human review and curation of found URLs
5. **CRAWLING** - Intelligent web scraping with depth control and link following
6. **BUNDLING** - Organize scraped content into structured research bundles
7. **ANALYSIS** - Generate AI-powered insights and summaries

This workflow allows for flexible research strategies, checkpoint resumption, and fine-grained control over each phase.

## Practical Example: Research Workflow

Let's say you want to research "Python async programming best practices":

### Without m1f-research (Manual Process):
1. Google search for relevant articles
2. Open each link, evaluate quality
3. Use `m1f-scrape` on each good URL
4. Run `m1f-html2md` to convert each file
5. Use `m1f` to bundle everything
6. Upload to Claude's Project Knowledge

### With m1f-research (Automated):
```bash
# One command does it all!
m1f-research "Python async programming best practices"
```

What happens behind the scenes:
1. **AI searches** for the best sources on Python async programming
2. **You review** the URLs (optional - can be skipped)
3. **Automatically scrapes** all approved URLs
4. **Converts** everything to Markdown
5. **Creates bundle** ready for Claude: `research_bundle.md`
6. **Generates summary** with key insights

The result: A complete research bundle you can directly upload to Claude's Project Knowledge!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic research - let AI find sources
m1f-research "microservices best practices"

# Research with more sources
m1f-research "react state management" --urls 30 --scrape 15

- Use local tools like `gemini-cli`
- Best for: Privacy, offline capability
- Example: `--provider gemini-cli`

## Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Use more URLs initially, let analysis filter
2. **Use templates**: Match template to your research goal
3. **Interactive mode**: Great for exploratory research
4. **Combine with m1f**: Feed research bundles into m1f for AI analysis

## Troubleshooting

### No API Key

```
Error: API key not set for ClaudeProvider
```

Solution: Set environment variable or pass in config

# Job Management in m1f-research

m1f-research uses a SQLite-based job management system that tracks all research
tasks, enabling persistence, resume functionality, and advanced filtering.

## Overview

Every research task creates a **job** with:

- Unique job ID
- SQLite databases for tracking
- Hierarchical directory structure
- Full resume capability
- Advanced search and filtering

## Job Structure

### Directory Layout

```
research-data/
├── research_jobs.db          # Main job tracking database
├── latest_research.md        # Symlink to most recent bundle
└── 2025/
    └── 07/
        └── 23/
            └── abc123_query-name/
                ├── research.db           # Job-specific database
                ├── research_bundle.md    # Main research bundle
                ├── research_summary.md   # Research summary
                └── metadata.json         # Job metadata
```

### Database Architecture

**Main Database (`research_jobs.db`)**

- Tracks all jobs across the system
- Stores job metadata and statistics
- Enables cross-job queries and filtering

**Per-Job Database (`research.db`)**

- URL tracking and status
- Content storage (markdown)
- Analysis results
- Filtering decisions

## Job Management Commands

### Listing Jobs

```bash
# List all jobs
m1f-research --list-jobs

# List with pagination
m1f-research --list-jobs --limit 10 --offset 20

# Filter by date
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07-23  # Specific day
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07     # Specific month
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025        # Specific year

# Search by query term
m1f-research --list-jobs --search "react"
m1f-research --list-jobs --search "tailwind"

# Combine filters
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07 --search "python" --limit 5
```

### Viewing Job Details

```bash
# Show detailed job status
m1f-research --status abc123
```

Output includes:

- Job ID and query
- Creation/update timestamps
- URL statistics
- Bundle availability
- Output directory

### Resuming Jobs

```bash
# Resume an interrupted job
m1f-research --resume abc123

# Add more URLs to existing job
m1f-research --resume abc123 --urls-file additional-urls.txt
```

## Advanced Filtering

### Pagination

Use `--limit` and `--offset` for large job lists:

```bash
# First page (10 items)
m1f-research --list-jobs --limit 10

# Second page
m1f-research --list-jobs --limit 10 --offset 10

# Third page
m1f-research --list-jobs --limit 10 --offset 20
```

### Date Filtering

Filter jobs by creation date:

```bash
# Jobs from today
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07-23

# Jobs from this month
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07

# Jobs from this year
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025
```

### Search Filtering

Find jobs by query content:

```bash
# Find all React-related research
m1f-research --list-jobs --search "react"

# Case-insensitive search
m1f-research --list-jobs --search "PYTHON"
```

Search terms are highlighted in the output for easy identification.

## Data Cleanup

### Cleaning Individual Jobs

Remove raw HTML data while preserving analysis:

```bash
# Clean specific job
m1f-research --clean-raw abc123
```

This removes:

- Raw HTML files
- Temporary download data

This preserves:

- Markdown content
- Analysis results
- Research bundles
- Job metadata

### Bulk Cleanup

Clean all jobs at once:

```bash
# Clean all raw data (with confirmation)
m1f-research --clean-all-raw
```

**Warning**: This action cannot be undone. You'll be prompted to confirm.

## Job Deletion

### Deleting Individual Jobs

Completely remove a job including all data:

```bash
# Delete specific job (with confirmation)
m1f-research --delete abc123

# Delete without confirmation prompt
m1f-research --delete abc123 --yes
```

When deleting a job, the system will:

1. Show job details (query, status, creation date, output path)
2. Request confirmation (unless `--yes` is used)
3. Remove the job from the database
4. Delete the entire job directory and all its contents
5. Report success or any errors encountered

**What gets deleted:**

- Database entry in `research_jobs.db`
- Job statistics in the database
- Entire job directory including:
  - Job-specific database (`research.db`)
  - Research bundle (`research_bundle.md`)
  - Research summary (`research_summary.md`)
  - All scraped content and analysis
  - Any metadata files

### Bulk Job Deletion

Delete multiple jobs based on filters:

```bash
# Delete all failed jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed

# Delete jobs from a specific month
m1f-research --delete-bulk --date 2025-01

# Delete jobs matching a search term
m1f-research --delete-bulk --search "test"

# Combine filters
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed --date 2025-01

# Skip confirmation (use with caution!)
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed --yes
```

**Bulk deletion process:**

1. Lists all jobs matching the filters
2. Shows a preview of jobs to be deleted (first 10)
3. Requests confirmation with total count
4. Deletes each job with progress tracking
5. Reports success/failure statistics

### Safety Features

#### Confirmation Prompts

By default, all deletion operations require confirmation:

```
Job to delete: abc123
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Query: python async best practices
Status: completed
Created: 2025-07-23 14:30:22
Output: research-data/2025/07/23/abc123_python-async-best-practices

⚠️  Delete job abc123 and all its data? [y/N]:
```

#### Error Handling

The deletion system handles errors gracefully:

- **Partial failures**: If filesystem deletion fails but database deletion succeeds, both are reported
- **Permission errors**: Attempts recovery with fallback methods
- **Missing jobs**: Clear error messages for non-existent job IDs
- **Failed deletions**: Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting

### Deletion vs Cleanup

| Operation | Database Entry | Job Directory | Research Bundle | Raw HTML | Recovery |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Clean Raw | ✓ Kept | ✓ Kept | ✓ Kept | ✗ Deleted | Can resume |
| Delete Job | ✗ Deleted | ✗ Deleted | ✗ Deleted | ✗ Deleted | Not recoverable |

**When to use cleanup:**
- Free disk space while keeping research results
- Job is complete but you want to keep the analysis
- Temporary space management

**When to use deletion:**
- Remove failed or test jobs
- Clean up old research no longer needed
- Complete removal of sensitive or outdated data
- Permanent space recovery

## Job Status

Jobs can have the following statuses:

| Status      | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `active`    | Job is currently running  |
| `completed` | Job finished successfully |
| `failed`    | Job encountered errors    |

## Manual URL Management

Add URLs from a file:

```bash
# Create URL file
cat > my-urls.txt << EOF
https://example.com/article1
https://example.com/article2
EOF

# Start new job with URLs
m1f-research "my topic" --urls-file my-urls.txt

# Add to existing job
m1f-research --resume abc123 --urls-file more-urls.txt
```

## Smart Delay Management

The scraper implements intelligent per-host delays:

- **No delay** for first 3 requests to any host
- **1-3 second random delay** after 3 requests
- **Parallel scraping** across different hosts

This ensures:

- Fast scraping for diverse sources
- Respectful behavior for repeated requests
- Optimal performance

## Examples

### Research Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start research
m1f-research "python async best practices"
# Output: Job ID: abc123

# 2. Check progress
m1f-research --status abc123

# 3. Add more URLs if needed
m1f-research --resume abc123 --urls-file extra-urls.txt

# 4. View all Python research
m1f-research --list-jobs --search "python"

# 5. Clean up old data
m1f-research --clean-raw abc123

# 6. Delete old or failed jobs
m1f-research --delete old-job-id
```

### Monthly Research Review

```bash
# List all research from July 2025
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07

# Page through results
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07 --limit 20
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07 --limit 20 --offset 20

# Find specific topic
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-07 --search "react hooks"
```

### Disk Space Management

```bash
# Check job sizes (future feature)
# m1f-research --list-jobs --show-size

# Clean raw data from specific job
m1f-research --clean-raw old-job-id

# Bulk cleanup of raw data
m1f-research --clean-all-raw

# Delete specific job completely
m1f-research --delete old-job-id

# Delete all failed jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed

# Delete old jobs from previous month
m1f-research --delete-bulk --date 2025-06
```

### Job Maintenance Workflow

```bash
# 1. List all jobs to review
m1f-research --list-jobs

# 2. Check failed jobs
m1f-research --list-jobs --status-filter failed

# 3. Delete all failed jobs after review
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed

# 4. Clean raw data from completed jobs
m1f-research --clean-all-raw

# 5. Delete old test jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --search "test" --yes
```

## Tips

1. **Use job IDs**: Save job IDs for easy resume/reference
2. **Regular cleanup**: Clean raw data after analysis is complete
3. **Combine filters**: Use multiple filters for precise searches
4. **Manual URLs**: Supplement LLM search with your own URLs
5. **Check status**: Monitor long-running jobs with --status
6. **Review before deletion**: Always check job details before deleting
7. **Use --yes carefully**: Only use automatic confirmation in scripts you trust
8. **Delete failed jobs**: Regularly remove failed jobs to keep workspace clean
9. **Backup important research**: Export important jobs before deletion

## Future Enhancements

- Export job lists to CSV/JSON
- Job size statistics
- Automatic cleanup policies
- Job tagging system
- Cross-job deduplication
- Job templates
- Scheduled deletion policies
- Job archiving before deletion
- Undo/recovery for recently deleted jobs

======= 65_architecture.md ======
# m1f-research Architecture

## Overview

The m1f-research tool is built on a modular architecture that combines web
search, content scraping, and AI-powered analysis to create comprehensive
research bundles.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)

- Central coordination of the research workflow
- Manages the 7-phase workflow system
- Handles configuration and state management
- Coordinates phase transitions and checkpoints

### 2. Workflow Manager (`workflow_phases.py`)

- Manages workflow phases and transitions
- Tracks phase completion and state
- Handles phase skipping based on configuration
- Provides resumption capabilities

### 3. Query Expander (`query_expander.py`)

- Generates multiple search query variations
- Uses LLM to create comprehensive query coverage
- Handles query expansion metadata
- Configurable expansion limits

### 4. URL Reviewer (`url_reviewer.py`)

- Interactive URL review and curation interface
- Allows human oversight of discovered URLs
- Supports batch operations and filtering
- Optional phase that can be skipped

### 5. Deep Crawler (`deep_crawler.py`)

- Intelligent multi-level web crawling
- Follows links to specified depth
- Respects domain limits and external link policies
- Integrates with URL filtering systems

### 6. LLM Interface (`llm_interface.py`)

- Abstraction layer for different LLM providers
- Supports Claude, Gemini, and CLI tools
- Manages API calls and response parsing

### 7. Scraper (`scraper.py`)

- Concurrent web scraping with rate limiting
- Integrates with html2md for content conversion
- Handles failures gracefully with retry logic

### 8. Analysis Generator (`analysis_generator.py`)

- Generates AI-powered insights and summaries
- Template-based analysis approaches
- Content relevance scoring and key points extraction
- Configurable analysis types

### 9. Bundle Creator (`bundle_creator.py`)

- Organizes scraped content into structured bundles
- Creates table of contents and summaries
- Formats output in clean Markdown
- Integrates phase-specific metadata

## Data Flow

### 7-Phase Workflow

```
User Query
    ↓
[1] INITIALIZATION
    ↓ (Configuration & Setup)
Workflow Manager
    ↓
[2] QUERY_EXPANSION (Optional)
    ↓ (Query Expander)
Expanded Queries
    ↓
[3] URL_COLLECTION
    ↓ (LLM Search)
Discovered URLs
    ↓
[4] URL_REVIEW (Optional)
    ↓ (URL Reviewer)
Curated URLs
    ↓
[5] CRAWLING
    ↓ (Deep Crawler + Scraper)
Raw Content
    ↓
[6] BUNDLING
    ↓ (Bundle Creator)
Research Bundle
    ↓
[7] ANALYSIS (Optional)
    ↓ (Analysis Generator)
Final Research Package
```

### Phase Dependencies

- INITIALIZATION → Required for all workflows
- QUERY_EXPANSION → Can be skipped if `expand_queries: false`
- URL_COLLECTION → Always required
- URL_REVIEW → Can be skipped if `skip_review: true`
- CRAWLING → Always required
- BUNDLING → Always required
- ANALYSIS → Can be skipped if `generate_analysis: false`

## Configuration System

The research tool uses a hierarchical configuration system:

1. **Default Config**: Built-in defaults
2. **User Config**: ~/.m1f.config.yml
3. **Project Config**: ./.m1f.config.yml
4. **CLI Arguments**: Command-line overrides

### Workflow Configuration

Workflow behavior is controlled by the `WorkflowConfig` class:

```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowConfig:
    expand_queries: bool = True        # Generate search query variations
    max_queries: int = 5              # Maximum expanded queries
    skip_review: bool = False         # Skip URL review interface
    crawl_depth: int = 0              # How many levels deep to crawl
    max_pages_per_site: int = 10      # Maximum pages per domain
    follow_external: bool = False     # Follow external links
    generate_analysis: bool = True    # Generate AI analysis
    analysis_type: str = "summary"    # Type of analysis to generate
```

## Templates

Templates customize the research process for different use cases:

- **Search Prompts**: How to find URLs
- **Analysis Focus**: What to extract
- **Output Format**: How to structure results

### Template Structure

```yaml
template_name:
  description: "Purpose of this template"
  search:
    focus: "What to look for"
    source_types: ["tutorial", "documentation", "discussion"]
  analysis:
    relevance_prompt: "Custom relevance criteria"
    key_points_prompt: "What to extract"
  output:
    structure: "How to organize results"
```

## Concurrency Model

The tool uses asyncio for efficient concurrent operations:

- **URL Search**: Sequential (LLM rate limits)
- **Web Scraping**: Concurrent with semaphore (default: 5)
- **Content Analysis**: Batch processing
- **Bundle Creation**: Sequential

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Failed scrapes don't stop the process
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient failures
- **Fallback Providers**: Switch providers on API errors
- **Detailed Logging**: Track issues for debugging

## Security Considerations

- **URL Validation**: Prevent SSRF attacks
- **Content Sanitization**: Remove potentially harmful content
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect server resources
- **API Key Management**: Secure credential handling

## Extension Points

The architecture supports several extension mechanisms:

1. **Custom Providers**: Add new LLM providers
2. **Scraper Backends**: Integrate new scraping tools
3. **Analysis Templates**: Create domain-specific templates
4. **Output Formats**: Add new bundle formats
5. **Workflow Phases**: Add custom phases to the workflow
6. **Crawling Strategies**: Implement domain-specific crawling logic
7. **URL Filters**: Create custom URL filtering rules
8. **Analysis Generators**: Add specialized analysis types

## Performance Optimizations

- **Concurrent Scraping**: Parallel downloads
- **Streaming Processing**: Handle large content
- **Caching**: Avoid duplicate work
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components on demand

## Future Architecture Plans

- **Plugin System**: Dynamic loading of extensions
- **Distributed Scraping**: Scale across multiple machines
- **Knowledge Graph**: Build connections between research
- **Real-time Updates**: Monitor sources for changes

======= 68_job_deletion_guide.md ======
# Job Deletion Guide for m1f-research

This guide covers the job deletion functionality in m1f-research, including best practices, safety features, and common workflows.

## Overview

Job deletion provides complete removal of research jobs from both the database and filesystem. Unlike cleanup operations that only remove raw data, deletion permanently removes all traces of a job.

## Why Delete Jobs?

- **Failed Jobs**: Remove jobs that encountered errors and cannot be resumed
- **Test Jobs**: Clean up experimental or test research runs
- **Outdated Research**: Remove old research that is no longer relevant
- **Space Management**: Recover disk space completely
- **Privacy**: Remove sensitive or confidential research data
- **Organization**: Keep your research workspace clean and manageable

## Deletion Commands

### Single Job Deletion

Delete a specific job by its ID:

```bash
m1f-research --delete JOB_ID
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Delete job with confirmation
m1f-research --delete abc123

# Skip confirmation (automation-friendly)
m1f-research --delete abc123 --yes
```

### Bulk Deletion

Delete multiple jobs based on filters:

```bash
m1f-research --delete-bulk [FILTERS]
```

**Available Filters:**
- `--status-filter {active,completed,failed}` - Filter by job status
- `--date DATE` - Filter by creation date (Y-M-D, Y-M, or Y format)
- `--search TERM` - Filter by search term in query
- `--yes` - Skip confirmation prompt

**Examples:**
```bash
# Delete all failed jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed

# Delete jobs from January 2025
m1f-research --delete-bulk --date 2025-01

# Delete test jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --search "test"

# Combine filters
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed --date 2025-07

# Automated deletion (no confirmation)
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed --yes
```

## What Gets Deleted?

When you delete a job, the following items are permanently removed:

### Database Entries
- Main job record in `research_jobs.db`
- Job statistics in the database
- All references and foreign key relationships

### Filesystem Data
- Entire job directory at `research-data/YYYY/MM/DD/job_id_query/`
- Job-specific database (`research.db`)
- Research bundle (`research_bundle.md`)
- Research summary (`research_summary.md`)
- All scraped HTML content
- All converted Markdown content
- Analysis results and metadata
- Any temporary or cache files

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Prompts

By default, all deletion operations show job details and require confirmation:

```
Job to delete: abc123
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Query: python async best practices
Status: completed
Created: 2025-07-23 14:30:22
Output: research-data/2025/07/23/abc123_python-async-best-practices

⚠️  Delete job abc123 and all its data? [y/N]:
```

For bulk deletion, you'll see a preview:

```
Jobs to delete (15 total)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [abc123] test query 1 (failed)
2. [def456] test query 2 (failed)
3. [ghi789] test query 3 (failed)
... and 12 more

⚠️  Delete 15 jobs with filters: status=failed? [y/N]:
```

### Error Handling

The deletion system handles various error scenarios:

- **Non-existent jobs**: Clear error message if job ID not found
- **Permission errors**: Attempts recovery with fallback methods
- **Partial failures**: Reports both successful and failed operations
- **Database integrity**: Uses transactions to prevent corruption

### Progress Tracking

Bulk deletions show real-time progress:

```
Deleting 25 jobs...
[████████████████████████████████████████] 100.0% Deletion complete
✅ Successfully deleted 23 jobs
❌ Failed to delete 2 jobs
  - job123: Permission denied
  - job456: Directory not found
```

## Deletion vs Cleanup Comparison

| Aspect | Clean Raw (`--clean-raw`) | Delete Job (`--delete`) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Database entry** | ✅ Preserved | ❌ Deleted |
| **Job directory** | ✅ Preserved | ❌ Deleted |
| **Research bundle** | ✅ Preserved | ❌ Deleted |
| **Analysis results** | ✅ Preserved | ❌ Deleted |
| **Raw HTML** | ❌ Deleted | ❌ Deleted |
| **Can resume** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Recoverable** | ✅ Partially | ❌ No |
| **Space saved** | 🟡 Moderate | 🟢 Maximum |

## Common Workflows

### Regular Maintenance

Clean up failed jobs weekly:

```bash
# Review failed jobs
m1f-research --list-jobs --status-filter failed

# Delete all failed jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed
```

### Monthly Cleanup

Remove old research monthly:

```bash
# List jobs from 2 months ago
m1f-research --list-jobs --date 2025-05

# Review and delete old jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --date 2025-05
```

### Project Cleanup

Clean up after a project:

```bash
# Find all project-related jobs
m1f-research --list-jobs --search "project-name"

# Delete project jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --search "project-name"
```

### Automated Cleanup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup-research.sh

# Delete failed jobs older than 7 days
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed --yes

# Clean raw data from completed jobs
m1f-research --clean-all-raw --yes

echo "Cleanup complete!"
```

## Best Practices

### Before Deleting

1. **Review job details**: Always check what you're about to delete
2. **Export important data**: Use `--export` to save job data if needed
3. **Check research bundles**: Ensure you have copies of important results
4. **Consider cleanup first**: Try `--clean-raw` if you only need space

### Safe Deletion

1. **Use filters carefully**: Test filters with `--list-jobs` first
2. **Start small**: Delete individual jobs before bulk operations
3. **Keep confirmations**: Only use `--yes` in trusted scripts
4. **Document deletions**: Keep a log of what was deleted and why

### Recovery Planning

Since deletion is permanent:

1. **Regular exports**: Export important jobs to JSON regularly
2. **Backup bundles**: Copy research bundles to a backup location
3. **Version control**: Consider committing important research to git
4. **Archive first**: Move old jobs to archive storage before deleting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Job not found" error:**
- Verify job ID with `--list-jobs`
- Check you're in the correct directory
- Ensure the job hasn't already been deleted

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Check file ownership and permissions
- Run with appropriate user privileges
- Consider using `sudo` if appropriate

**Partial deletion failures:**
- Check disk space and permissions
- Review error messages for specific issues
- Manually remove remaining files if needed

### Recovery from Mistakes

Unfortunately, deletion is permanent. To minimize risk:

1. Always review before confirming
2. Test with dry runs when possible
3. Keep backups of important research
4. Use cleanup instead of deletion when unsure

## FAQ

**Q: Can I undo a deletion?**
A: No, deletion is permanent. Always confirm before deleting.

**Q: What's the difference between cleanup and deletion?**
A: Cleanup removes only raw HTML data. Deletion removes everything.

**Q: Can I delete active jobs?**
A: Yes, but it's not recommended. Stop the job first if possible.

**Q: How do I delete jobs older than X days?**
A: Use date filters, e.g., `--delete-bulk --date 2025-06` for June 2025.

**Q: Is there a way to archive before deleting?**
A: Use `--export` to save job data, then manually archive files before deletion.

**Q: Can I recover a deleted job from the database?**
A: No, deletion removes all database entries permanently.

## Command Reference

### Options
- `--delete JOB_ID` - Delete a specific job
- `--delete-bulk` - Delete multiple jobs with filters
- `--yes` - Skip confirmation prompts
- `--status-filter` - Filter by job status
- `--date` - Filter by creation date
- `--search` - Filter by query content

### Examples
```bash
# Delete specific job
m1f-research --delete abc123

# Delete with auto-confirmation
m1f-research --delete abc123 --yes

# Delete failed jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed

# Delete old jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --date 2025-01

# Delete test jobs
m1f-research --delete-bulk --search "test"

# Combined filters
m1f-research --delete-bulk --status-filter failed --date 2025-07 --yes
```

## Summary

Job deletion is a powerful feature for managing your research workspace. Use it wisely:

- ✅ Delete failed and test jobs regularly
- ✅ Review before confirming deletions
- ✅ Use filters to target specific jobs
- ⚠️ Remember deletion is permanent
- ⚠️ Keep backups of important research
