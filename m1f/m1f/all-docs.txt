# m1f - Make One File 🚀

**Feed your AI the whole story.**

## What is m1f?

m1f (Make One File) bundles your entire codebase into a single file that you can
feed to Claude AI, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or any LLM. Think of it as a context
maximizer - it takes hundreds of files from your project and intelligently
combines them into one mega-file that fits perfectly in an AI's context window.

## Real Example: Tailwind CSS Documentation

Here's the problem: Tailwind's documentation is constantly evolving, but most
LLMs are stuck with outdated information.

The solution? Three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com
cd tailwindcss.com && m1f-init
m1f-claude --advanced-setup
```

Boom. Now Claude knows everything about the latest Tailwind CSS. The bundles are
created in the `m1f/` directory - you can reference them in Claude with
`@m1f/tailwind_complete.txt` or `@m1f/tailwind_docs.txt`. Your AI assistant just
became an expert on bleeding-edge tech that didn't exist when it was trained.
That's the power of m1f.

> **🔐 Security Note**: m1f automatically scans for secrets (API keys,
> passwords, tokens) using
> [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) to prevent
> accidental exposure to LLMs. It'll warn you before bundling sensitive data!

## The Tool Suite

m1f isn't just one tool - it's a whole squad:

- **m1f** - The main bundler that creates your mega-files
- **m1f-s1f** - Splits bundles back into individual files
- **m1f-scrape** - Downloads entire websites for offline processing
- **m1f-html2md** - Converts HTML docs to clean Markdown
- **m1f-token-counter** - Checks if your bundle fits in context windows
- **m1f-claude** - AI assistant that already knows your codebase

- **Size filtering** - Skip those massive log files automatically

## The Squad

### 🎯 **m1f** - The Bundler

Combines multiple files into a single, AI-friendly mega-file. Smart enough to
deduplicate content, handle any encoding, and even scan for secrets. Because
nobody wants their API keys in a ChatGPT conversation.

```bash
# Bundle your entire project (but smart about it)
m1f -s ./your-project -o context.txt --preset presets/wordpress.m1f-presets.yml
```

### ✂️ **m1f-s1f** - The Splitter

Extracts files back from bundles. Perfect for when your AI assistant generates
that perfect codebase and you need it back in actual files.

```bash
# Unbundle that AI-generated masterpiece
m1f-s1f -i bundle.txt -d ./extracted
```

### 🌐 **m1f-scrape** - The Collector

Downloads entire websites for offline processing. Multiple backends for
different scenarios - from simple HTML to JavaScript-heavy SPAs.

```bash
# Scrape documentation sites for offline reference
m1f-scrape https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code -o ./claude-code-docs -v
```

### 📝 **m1f-html2md** - The Converter

Transforms HTML into clean Markdown. Use AI to analyze structure and suggest
optimal selectors, then convert with precision.

```bash
# AI-powered analysis to find best selectors
m1f-html2md analyze ./html --claude

# Convert using the suggested selectors
m1f-html2md convert ./html -o ./markdown \
  --content-selector "main, article" \
  --ignore-selectors "nav, .sidebar"
```

### 🔢 **m1f-token-counter** - The Calculator

Counts tokens before you hit those pesky context limits. Support for all major
LLM encodings.

```bash
# Will it fit?
m1f-token-counter ./bundle.txt
```

## Real-World Magic

### Feed Documentation to Your AI Assistant

```bash
# React Documentation - From Git Repository
git clone https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev
cd react.dev && m1f-init

# This creates two bundles:
# - m1f/react_complete.txt (full codebase)
# - m1f/react_docs.txt (docs only)

# Or create custom bundles
m1f -s ./src/content -o react-api-docs.txt \
  --include-extensions .md .mdx \
  --docs-only
```

### Smart WordPress Development

```bash
# Bundle your theme with intelligent filtering
m1f -s ./wp-content/themes/mytheme -o theme-context.txt \
    --preset presets/wordpress.m1f-presets.yml
```

### Auto-Bundle Your Project

```bash
# Set it and forget it
m1f-update
# Or watch for changes
./scripts/watch_and_bundle.sh
```

## Why You'll Love It

- **🧠 AI-First**: Built specifically for LLM context windows
- **⚡ Fast AF**: Async I/O, parallel processing, the works
- **🎨 Presets**: WordPress, web projects, documentation - we got you
- **🔒 Security**: Automatic secret detection (because accidents happen)
- **📦 All-in-One**: Download, convert, bundle, done

## Quick Start

### Linux/macOS (3 commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/franz-agency/m1f.git
cd m1f
source ./scripts/install.sh
```

### Windows (3 commands + restart)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/franz-agency/m1f.git
cd m1f
.\scripts\install.ps1
# Restart PowerShell or run: . $PROFILE
```

That's it! ✨ The installer handles everything:

- ✅ Checks Python 3.10+
- ✅ Creates virtual environment
- ✅ Installs all dependencies
- ✅ Generates initial bundles
- ✅ Sets up global commands

Test it:

```bash
m1f --help
m1f-update
```

## Pro Tips

- Start small: Test with a few files before going wild
- Use presets: They're there for a reason
- Check token counts: Your LLM will thank you
- Read the docs: Seriously, they're pretty good

## Real Example: Scraping Claude Code Documentation 🤖

Want to give Claude its own Claude Code documentation? Here's how to scrape and
bundle the Anthropic docs:

It's completely baffling to us that Claude Code doesn't have its own
documentation internally and has to look up parameters and syntax online. But
now there's help: scrape the documentation, convert it to markdown files, and
feed it to Claude Code!

```bash
# 1. Download Claude Code documentation (specific section only)
m1f-scrape https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code -o ./claude-code-html

# 2. Analyze HTML structure with AI to get optimal selectors
# Note: m1f-html2md now auto-detects Claude installations (including ~/.claude/local/claude)
m1f-html2md analyze ./claude-code-html --claude

# 3. Convert to clean Markdown using the suggested selectors
m1f-html2md convert ./claude-code-html -o ./claude-code-md \
  --content-selector "main, article" \
  --ignore-selectors "nav, .sidebar"

# 4. Create the mega-bundle for Claude
m1f -s ./claude-code-md -o claude-code-documentation.txt \
  --remove-scraped-metadata

# 5. Check if it fits (Claude can handle 200k tokens)
m1f-token-counter ./claude-code-documentation.txt
```

### The Result?

Now you can literally tell Claude: "Hey, here's your Claude Code documentation"
and paste the entire context. Perfect for:

- Building Claude-powered tools with accurate API knowledge
- Creating Claude Code integration guides
- Having Claude help debug its own API calls
- Getting Claude to write better prompts for itself (meta!)

### Pro tip: Keep It Fresh 🌿

Set up a weekly cron job to re-scrape and rebuild:

```bash
# Add to your crontab
0 0 * * 0 cd /path/to/m1f && ./scripts/scrape-claude-docs.sh
```

Where `scrape-claude-docs.sh` contains the full pipeline above.

## Beyond AI: Other Cool Uses

m1f isn't just for feeding LLMs. Here's what else you can do:

### 📦 **Backup & Versioning**

Bundle your project → timestamp it → instant versioned backups. Extract
anywhere, anytime with m1f-s1f.

### 🎨 **CSS/JS Bundler**

Poor man's webpack? Bundle all your CSS and JS files into one. Perfect for
simple projects that don't need the complexity of modern build tools.

### 🔄 **Universal File Converter**

Got mixed encodings? Latin-1, UTF-16, Windows-1252? m1f auto-detects and
converts everything to UTF-8 (or whatever you want). One command, all files
normalized.

### 🚚 **Project Migration**

Bundle on machine A → transfer one file → extract on machine B. All paths and
metadata preserved. Like tar, but readable as text file.

```bash
# Example: Full project backup with timestamp
m1f -s . -o backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt --add-timestamp

# Extract it anywhere
m1f-s1f -i backup_20250115_143022.txt -d ./restored_project
```

## Documentation

Project documentation is located in the `docs/` directory with comprehensive guides for each tool.

## Configuration Systems

### Preset System
Located in `presets/` with templates for:
- WordPress projects (`wordpress.m1f-presets.yml`)
- Web projects (`web-project.m1f-presets.yml`)
- Documentation sites (`documentation.m1f-presets.yml`)
- AI-context optimization (`ai-context.m1f-presets.yml`)

### Auto-bundling
- `.m1f.config.yml` defines project-specific bundle configurations
- Git hooks available for automatic bundle generation on commits
- Watch scripts for real-time bundle updates

## Security Considerations

The project implements comprehensive security measures:
- **Path validation** to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Secret detection** using detect-secrets integration
- **SSRF protection** for web scraping backends
- **robots.txt compliance** (always enabled, cannot be disabled)
- **SSL/TLS validation** enabled by default

## Key Development Patterns

### Version Management
- Single source of truth in `tools/_version.py`
- Automatic syncing across all components
- Use `scripts/bump_version.py` for version updates

### Async Architecture
All file operations use async I/O patterns:
```python
# Standard pattern for file operations
async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    content = await f.read()
```

### Error Handling
Custom exception hierarchy with specific error types for different failure modes.

### Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive test coverage with pytest
- Async test support with pytest-asyncio
- Integration tests including HTML test server
- Security-focused tests for path traversal and injection attacks

## m1f Best Practices

When working with m1f functionality:
- Create focused bundles under 100KB for optimal AI context windows
- Use appropriate separators: Standard (default) for AI consumption, not Markdown
- Leverage the preset system for consistent file processing
- Exclude unnecessary files using default excludes (automatically handles node_modules, .git, etc.)
- Use security scanning to prevent secrets in bundles

## Key Documentation Files

# Perfect Bundle Creation Prompt for m1f-claude

## 🎯 CREATE PERFECT TOPIC-SPECIFIC BUNDLES FOR THIS PROJECT

============================================================

The basic bundles (complete.txt and docs.txt) have already been created. Now
create additional topic-specific bundles following BEST PRACTICES.

## 📚 REQUIRED READING (IN THIS ORDER):

1. READ: @m1f/m1f.txt for m1f documentation and bundle configuration syntax
2. READ: @m1f/project_analysis_dirlist.txt for directory structure
3. READ: @m1f/project_analysis_filelist.txt for complete file listing

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read ALL three files above before proceeding!

## 🏆 BEST PRACTICES FOR PERFECT BUNDLES

### 1. MODULAR ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE

- Identify each logical module, tool, or subsystem in the project
- Create one bundle per module/tool (e.g., auth-module, payment-module,
  user-module)
- Each module bundle should be self-contained and meaningful

### 2. USE PRECISE INCLUDES, NOT BROAD EXCLUDES

Instead of excluding everything except what you want, use precise includes:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD - Too broad, relies on excludes
sources:
  - path: "."
    excludes: ["tests/", "docs/", "scripts/", "node_modules/"]

# ✅ GOOD - Precise includes
sources:
  - path: "tools/"
    include_extensions: [".py"]
    includes: ["auth/**", "auth.py", "utils.py", "__init__.py"]
```

### 3. BUNDLE GROUPING STRATEGY

Organize bundles into logical groups:

- `documentation` - All documentation bundles
- `source` - Source code bundles by module
- `tests` - Test code bundles
- `config` - Configuration bundles
- `complete` - Aggregated bundles

### 4. NUMBERED OUTPUT FILES

Use numbered prefixes for proper sorting:

```yaml
output: "m1f/project/87_module1_docs.txt"  # Documentation
output: "m1f/project/94_module1_code.txt"  # Source code
output: "m1f/project/95_module2_code.txt"  # Source code
output: "m1f/project/99_complete.txt"      # Complete bundle
```

### 5. HIERARCHICAL BUNDLES

Create aggregated bundles that combine related bundles:

- `all-docs` - Combines all documentation
- `all-tests` - Combines all tests
- `all-frontend` - Combines all frontend code
- `complete` - The ultimate bundle with everything

### 6. SHARED FILES STRATEGY

When files are used by multiple modules (like utils, constants, types):

- Include them in each relevant module bundle
- This ensures each bundle is self-contained

## 🔍 PROJECT ANALYSIS STEPS

### STEP 1: Identify Project Architecture

Analyze the directory structure to find:

- Monorepo with packages? → Create bundle per package
- Multiple apps/services? → Create bundle per app
- Modular architecture? → Create bundle per module
- Plugin/Extension system? → Create bundle per plugin
- Frontend/Backend split? → Create bundles for each

### STEP 2: Find Logical Boundaries

Look for natural boundaries in the code:

- Directory names that indicate modules (auth/, payment/, user/)
- File naming patterns (auth.service.ts, auth.controller.ts)
- Configuration files that define modules
- Import patterns that show dependencies

### STEP 3: Design Bundle Hierarchy

Plan your bundles in this order:

1. Module/tool-specific bundles (most granular)
2. Category bundles (tests, docs, config)
3. Aggregated bundles (all-docs, all-frontend)
4. Complete bundle (everything)

## 📝 BUNDLE CREATION RULES

### NAMING CONVENTIONS

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `user-service`, `auth-module`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group prefix when applicable: `frontend-components`, `backend-api`

### OUTPUT FILE PATTERNS

```
m1f/{project_name}/
├── 80-89_*_docs.txt     # Documentation bundles
├── 90-93_*_config.txt   # Configuration bundles
├── 94-98_*_code.txt     # Source code bundles
└── 99_*_complete.txt    # Complete/aggregated bundles
```

### SOURCES CONFIGURATION

Always use the most specific configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  - path: "src/modules/auth"
    include_extensions: [".ts", ".js"]
    includes: ["**/*.service.ts", "**/*.controller.ts"]
  - path: "src/shared"
    includes: ["auth-utils.ts", "auth-types.ts"]
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

1. **NO DEFAULT EXCLUDES**: Don't exclude node_modules, .git, **pycache**, etc.
2. **NO BINARY/ASSET BUNDLES**: Skip images, fonts, compiled files
3. **MAX 20 BUNDLES**: Including existing complete and docs
4. **USE INCLUDES OVER EXCLUDES**: Be precise about what to include
5. **SELF-CONTAINED BUNDLES**: Each bundle should be useful standalone

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

□ Read all three required files completely □ Identify the project's modular
structure □ Plan bundle hierarchy (modules → categories → aggregated) □ Design
precise `includes` patterns for each bundle □ Use numbered output files for
sorting □ Group bundles logically □ Create aggregated bundles where valuable □
Keep total count under 20 bundles □ Use MultiEdit to add all bundles at once

## 💡 EXAMPLE PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE

### For a Multi-Service Project:

```yaml
bundles:
  # Service-specific bundles
  auth-service:
    group: "services"
    output: "m1f/project/94_auth_service.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "services/auth"
        include_extensions: [".js", ".ts"]
      - path: "shared"
        includes: ["auth/**", "types/auth.ts"]

  user-service:
    group: "services"
    output: "m1f/project/95_user_service.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "services/user"
        include_extensions: [".js", ".ts"]
      - path: "shared"
        includes: ["user/**", "types/user.ts"]
```

### For a Plugin-Based System:

```yaml
bundles:
  plugin-core:
    group: "core"
    output: "m1f/project/94_plugin_core.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "core"
        include_extensions: [".py"]
      - path: "plugins"
        includes: ["__init__.py", "base.py"]

  plugin-auth:
    group: "plugins"
    output: "m1f/project/95_plugin_auth.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "plugins/auth"
      - path: "core"
        includes: ["plugin_utils.py"]
```

## ⚡ FINAL STEPS

1. Analyze the project structure deeply
2. Design bundles that reflect the project's architecture
3. Use precise includes to create focused bundles
4. Test your mental model: "Would each bundle be useful alone?"
5. Create the configuration with MultiEdit

Remember: The goal is bundles that are **modular**, **focused**, and
**self-contained**!

## Using m1f in Other Projects

### Quick Setup for AI-Assisted Development

When starting a new project with m1f, use the `m1f-init` command for quick
setup:

```bash
cd /your/project
m1f-init
```

This command:

- Creates `m1f/m1f.txt` - a symlink to the complete m1f documentation
- Analyzes your project structure
- Generates initial bundles with auxiliary files:
  - `m1f/<project>_complete.txt` - Full project bundle
  - `m1f/<project>_complete_filelist.txt` - List of all included files
  - `m1f/<project>_complete_dirlist.txt` - List of all directories
  - `m1f/<project>_docs.txt` - Documentation bundle
  - `m1f/<project>_docs_filelist.txt` - List of documentation files
  - `m1f/<project>_docs_dirlist.txt` - Documentation directories
- Creates a basic `.m1f.config.yml`
- Shows platform-specific next steps

#### Working with Generated File Lists

The file lists created by `m1f-init` can be edited to customize future bundles:

```bash
# Edit the complete file list to remove unwanted files
vi m1f/<project>_complete_filelist.txt

# Use the edited list to create a custom bundle
m1f -i m1f/<project>_complete_filelist.txt -o m1f/custom_bundle.txt

# Create a bundle from specific directories (edit dirlist first)
m1f -s . -i m1f/selected_dirs.txt -o m1f/specific_areas.txt
```

For advanced setup with topic-specific bundles (Linux/macOS only):

```bash
m1f-claude --advanced-setup
```

#### Example AI Prompts:

```bash
# Ask Claude Code to create a configuration
"Please read @m1f/m1f.txt and create a .m1f.config.yml
for my Python web project"

# Get help with specific use cases
"Based on @m1f/m1f.txt, how do I exclude all test
files but include fixture data?"

# Troubleshoot issues
"I'm getting this error: [error message]. Can you check
@m1f/m1f.txt to help me fix it?"
```

The AI will understand:

- All m1f commands and parameters
- How to create `.m1f.config.yml` files
- Preset system and file processing options
- Best practices for different project types

    `/products` when `/docs` is specified)
  - Works with all scraper backends (BeautifulSoup, HTTrack, Selectolax)
  - Useful for downloading specific documentation sections without the entire
    website
  - Example: `m1f-scrape https://api.example.com/v2/reference` only scrapes
    pages under `/v2/reference`

- **WebScraper Ignore GET Parameters**: New option to prevent duplicate content
  from URLs with different query strings

    `m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./html --ignore-get-params`
    - Will treat `docs.html?version=1` and `docs.html?version=2` as the same
      page

- **WebScraper Canonical URL Checking**: Automatically skip duplicate pages
  based on canonical URLs
  - **Default Behavior**: Checks `<link rel="canonical">` tags on every page
    - Skips pages where canonical URL differs from current URL
    - Prevents downloading duplicate content (print versions, mobile versions,
      etc.)
    - Works with all scraper backends (BeautifulSoup, HTTrack, Selectolax)
    - Logs skipped pages with their canonical URLs for transparency
  - **--ignore-canonical Flag**: Ignore canonical tags when needed
    - Use when you want all page versions regardless of canonical tags
    - Example: `m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --ignore-canonical`
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Documentation sites with multiple URL formats for same content
    - E-commerce sites with product URLs containing tracking parameters
    - News sites with print and mobile versions of articles

### Fixed

# AI Context File Generator & Auto-Bundling System

## Overview

This directory contains tasks for creating selective file bundles that serve as
context for AI interactions. The system includes:

1. **Manual Selection** - Create bundles from carefully selected files
2. **Auto-Bundling** - Automatically organize project content into topic-based
   bundles
3. **Preset System** - Apply file-specific processing rules
4. **Watch Mode** - Automatically regenerate bundles when files change

Using the `m1f` tool and auto-bundling scripts, you can create optimized context
files for AI assistants.

## VS Code Setup

To use these tasks in VS Code:

1. Create a `.vscode` directory in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. Copy the example tasks configuration:
   ```bash
   cp tasks/example.tasks.json .vscode/tasks.json
   ```
3. Now you can access all tasks via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` →
   "Tasks: Run Task")

The `example.tasks.json` file references all available task definitions:

- `m1f.json` - Manual file selection tasks
- `auto_bundle.json` - Automated bundling tasks with preset support
- `linting.json` - Code quality and linting tasks

**Note**: The `.vscode` directory is typically gitignored, so each developer can
customize their tasks.json as needed.

## When to Use This Tool

**Do NOT use this tool if:**

- You only have a few files to work with (just reference them directly)
- You want to include your entire project (this will overwhelm the AI with
  irrelevant information)

**DO use this tool when:**

- You have a large project (hundreds or thousands of files)
- You need to provide context from ~50 key files that are most relevant to your
  current task
- You want to give the AI a focused understanding of specific parts of your
  codebase

## Purpose

When working with AI assistants (like those in Windsurf, Cursor, VS Code, or
other AI-enabled editors), providing selective but sufficient context is
essential. This tool helps you to:

1. Select and combine only the most important files into a single document
2. Include metadata that helps AI systems understand file relationships
3. Create machine-readable formats optimized for Large Language Models
4. Efficiently manage context limitations by focusing on what matters

## Available Task Files

This directory contains several task definition files:

### Task Definition Files

1. **m1f.json** - Core context generation tasks for manual file selection
2. **auto_bundle.json** - Automated bundling tasks with 11 different bundle
   types
3. **linting.json** - Code quality and linting tasks
4. **example.tasks.json** - Example VS Code tasks.json that integrates all task
   files

### Supporting Files

- **ai_context_files.txt** - Example list of files for manual context creation
- **wp\_\*.txt** - WordPress-specific include/exclude patterns

### m1f.json - Core Context Generation Tasks

The `m1f.json` file defines core tasks for manual file selection:

### 1. AI Context: Create Combined File

This task combines files from your project with common exclusions:

- **Source**: Project directory with extensive filtering
- **Output**: `.gen/ai_context.m1f.txt`
- **Excludes**: Non-relevant directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `.venv`, etc.)
- **Format**: Machine-readable format with clear file separators
- **Optimization**: Uses `--minimal-output` to generate only the combined file
  without extra logs or lists
- **Best for**: Initial exploration when you're unsure which files are important

### 2. AI Context: Create From Input List (Recommended)

This task combines only the specific files you select:

- **Source**: Files explicitly listed in `tasks/ai_context_files.txt`
- **Output**: `.gen/ai_context_custom.m1f.txt`
- **Format**: Same machine-readable format
- **Efficiency**: Uses `--minimal-output --quiet` for silent operation with no
  auxiliary files
- **Best for**: Focused work when you know which ~20-50 files are most relevant

## Practical Usage Guide

### Step 1: Identify Key Files

Start by identifying the most important files for your current task:

- **Core files**: Main entry points, key modules, and configuration files
- **Relevant to your task**: Files you're actively working on or need to
  understand
- **Context providers**: Files that explain project structure or domain concepts
- **Aim for 20-50 files**: This provides enough context without overwhelming the
  AI

### Step 2: Create Your Custom File List

The recommended approach is to create a task-specific file list in
`ai_context_files.txt`:

```
# Core modules for authentication feature
${workspaceFolder}/auth/user.py
${workspaceFolder}/auth/permissions.py
${workspaceFolder}/auth/tokens.py

# Configuration
${workspaceFolder}/config/settings.py

# Related utilities
${workspaceFolder}/utils/crypto.py
```

### Step 3: Generate the Context File

1. Open Windsurf/VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task" and press Enter
3. Select "AI Context: Create From Input List" (recommended)
4. The task will run and create the output file in the `.gen` directory

### Step 4: Use with AI

1. Open the generated `.m1f.txt` file in your editor
2. In your AI-enabled editor (Windsurf, Cursor, VS Code):
   - Include this file in the AI's context using the editor's method
   - In Windsurf: Type `@filename` in chat or use the "Add to Context" option

### auto_bundle.json - Automated Topic-Based Bundling

The `auto_bundle.json` file provides tasks for automatic bundle generation:

#### Available Auto-Bundle Tasks:

1. **Auto Bundle: Docs Bundle** - All documentation, READMEs, and markdown files
2. **Auto Bundle: Source Bundle** - All source code files
3. **Auto Bundle: Tests Bundle** - All test files and fixtures
4. **Auto Bundle: Complete Bundle** - Combined documentation, source, and tests
5. **Auto Bundle: Custom Focus** - Topic-specific bundles (html2md, m1f, s1f,
   etc.)
6. **Auto Bundle: Watch and Update** - Monitor changes and regenerate bundles
7. **Auto Bundle: With Preset** - Apply processing rules during bundling
8. **Auto Bundle: Generate All Bundles** - Creates all standard bundles in one
   go
9. **Auto Bundle: Preset - All Standard** - Creates all standard preset-based
   bundles
10. **Auto Bundle: Preset - Focused** - Creates focused bundles using presets
11. **Auto Bundle: List Presets** - Lists all available presets and their groups

#### Using Auto-Bundle Tasks:

1. Open VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select an auto-bundle task (e.g., "Auto Bundle: Complete Bundle")
4. The bundle will be created in `.ai-context/`

#### Configuration:

Auto-bundling is configured via `.m1f.config.yml`. See the
[Auto Bundle Guide](../docs/01_m1f/06_auto_bundle_guide.md) for details.

#### Preset-Based Auto-Bundling:

The preset-based tasks (9-11) use the `scripts/auto_bundle_preset.sh` script
which leverages the m1f preset system:

- **Intelligent file filtering** - Presets apply smart includes/excludes based
  on file type
- **Per-file-type processing** - Different settings for different file
  extensions
- **Security scanning control** - Enable/disable security checks per file type
- **Size limit management** - Different size limits for CSS vs PHP files
- **Processing actions** - Minify, strip tags, compress whitespace per file type

Example preset usage:

```bash
# Create all standard bundles using presets
m1f-update all

# Create WordPress-specific bundles
m1f-update focus wordpress

# Use specific preset with group
m1f auto-bundle preset web-project frontend
```

Available presets:

- `wordpress` - WordPress themes and plugins with appropriate excludes
- `web-project` - Modern web projects with frontend/backend separation
- `documentation` - Documentation-focused bundles
- `example-globals` - Example with comprehensive global settings

See [m1f Presets Documentation](../docs/01_m1f/02_m1f_presets.md) for detailed
preset information.

## Best Practices for Effective AI Context

### For Manual Selection:

1. **Be selective**: Choose only the most important 20-50 files for your current
   task
2. **Include structure files**: Add README.md, configuration files, and key
   interfaces
3. **Group related files**: When customizing your list, organize files by
   related functionality
4. **Comment your file lists**: Add comments in `ai_context_files.txt` to
   explain why files are included

### For Auto-Bundling:

1. **Use focused bundles**: Start with topic-specific bundles (docs, src) before
   using complete
2. **Configure properly**: Customize `.m1f.config.yml` for your project
   structure
3. **Apply presets**: Use the preset system to optimize file processing
4. **Watch mode**: Use watch tasks during active development
5. **Refresh regularly**: Regenerate bundles after significant changes

## Customizing the Process

You can customize the tasks by editing `m1f.json` for your specific needs:

- Modify output file locations and naming conventions
- Adjust file exclusion patterns for your project structure
- Add task-specific configurations for different project components

## Additional Options

Consider these advanced options from `m1f` for specific needs:

- `--include-dot-paths`: Useful for including WordPress-specific configuration
  files like `.htaccess` or other dot files and directories (e.g., `.config/`,
  `.github/`) if they are relevant to your context. By default, all files and
  directories starting with a dot are excluded.
- `--separator-style`: While `MachineReadable` is generally recommended for AI
  context files, you can explore other styles if needed.
- `--skip-output-file`: Executes all operations (logs, additional files, etc.)
  but skips writing the final .m1f.txt output file. Useful when you're only
  interested in generating the file and directory listings or logs, but not the
  combined content file itself.

For a complete list of all available options and their detailed descriptions,
run:

```
m1f --help
```

## Machine-Readable Format

The default separator style "MachineReadable" optimizes the combined file for AI
understanding:

```
--- PYMK1F_BEGIN_FILE_METADATA_BLOCK_f84a9c25-b8cf-4e6a-a39d-842d7fe3b6e1 ---
METADATA_JSON:
{
    "original_filepath": "relative/path.ext",
    "original_filename": "path.ext",
    "timestamp_utc_iso": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "type": ".ext",
    "size_bytes": 1234,
    "checksum_sha256": "abc123..."
}
--- PYMK1F_END_FILE_METADATA_BLOCK_f84a9c25-b8cf-4e6a-a39d-842d7fe3b6e1 ---
--- PYMK1F_BEGIN_FILE_CONTENT_BLOCK_f84a9c25-b8cf-4e6a-a39d-842d7fe3b6e1 ---

[file content]

--- PYMK1F_END_FILE_CONTENT_BLOCK_f84a9c25-b8cf-4e6a-a39d-842d7fe3b6e1 ---
```

This format ensures the AI can clearly identify file boundaries and understand
metadata about each file, making it more effective in processing your selected
files. The JSON metadata includes the original filepath, filename, timestamp in
ISO format, file type, size in bytes, and SHA256 checksum for data integrity
verification. It's particularly suitable for automated processing and splitting
back into individual files.

## Use Case: WordPress Theme/Plugin Context File

When developing WordPress themes or plugins, you often need to provide an AI
assistant with the context of your specific theme/plugin files. Here's how you
can create a single context file for this purpose using `m1f.py`:

### 1. Strategically Select WordPress Files

To create an effective AI context for WordPress development, carefully select
files that represent the functionality or problem area you're focusing on.
Consider these categories:

- **Core Theme Files**:

  - `style.css` (for theme identity and metadata)
  - `functions.php` (critical for theme logic, hooks, and filters)
  - `index.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, `sidebar.php` (main template
    structure)
  - Specific template files relevant to your task: `single.php`, `page.php`,
    `archive.php`, `category.php`, `tag.php`, `search.php`, `404.php`,
    `front-page.php`, `home.php`.
  - Template parts (e.g., files in `template-parts/` directory like
    `content-page.php`).
  - Customizer settings and controls if relevant (`inc/customizer.php`).
  - Key JavaScript (e.g., `assets/js/custom.js`) and CSS files.

- **Core Plugin Files**:

  - The main plugin file (e.g., `your-plugin-name/your-plugin-name.php`) which
    includes the plugin header.
  - Files containing main classes, action/filter hooks, shortcodes, and admin
    panel logic.
  - AJAX handlers, REST API endpoint definitions.
  - Files related to Custom Post Types (CPTs) or taxonomies defined by the
    plugin.
  - Key JavaScript and CSS files specific to the plugin's functionality.

- **Feature-Specific Files**: If you are working on a particular feature (e.g.,
  WooCommerce integration, a custom contact form, a specific admin page):

  - Include all files directly related to that feature from both your theme and
    any relevant plugins.
  - For example, for WooCommerce: relevant template overrides in
    `your-theme/woocommerce/`, custom functions related to WooCommerce in
    `functions.php` or a plugin.

- **Problem-Specific Files**: If debugging, include files involved in the error
  stack trace or areas where the bug is suspected.

- **Important Note on Parent/Child Themes**:
  - If using a child theme, include relevant files from _both_ the child theme
    and parent theme that interact or are being overridden.

### 2. Structure Your Input File List (`my_wp_context_files.txt`)

Create a plain text file (e.g., `my_wp_context_files.txt`) listing the absolute
or relative paths to your selected files. Organize and comment this list for
clarity, especially if you plan to reuse or modify it.

**Example `my_wp_context_files.txt` for a theme feature and a related plugin:**

```plaintext
# Paths should be relative to your project root, or absolute.
# For VS Code tasks, ${workspaceFolder} can be used.

# =====================================
# My Custom Theme: "AwesomeTheme"
# Working on: Homepage Slider Feature
# =====================================

# Core Theme Files
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/style.css
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/functions.php
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/header.php
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/footer.php
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/front-page.php

# Homepage Slider Specifics
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/template-parts/homepage-slider.php
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/includes/slider-customizer-settings.php
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/assets/js/homepage-slider.js
wp-content/themes/AwesomeTheme/assets/css/homepage-slider.css

# =====================================
# Related Plugin: "UtilityPlugin"
# Used by: Homepage Slider for data
# =====================================
wp-content/plugins/UtilityPlugin/utility-plugin.php
wp-content/plugins/UtilityPlugin/includes/class-data-provider.php
wp-content/plugins/UtilityPlugin/includes/cpt-slides.php

# =====================================
# General WordPress Context (Optional)
# =====================================
# Consider adding if debugging core interactions, but be selective:
# wp-includes/post.php
# wp-includes/query.php
```

**Tips for your list:**

- Use comments (`#`) to organize sections or explain choices.
- Start with a small, focused set of files and expand if the AI needs more
  context.
- Paths are typically relative to where you run the `m1f.py` script, or from the
  `${workspaceFolder}` if using VS Code tasks.

### 3. Generate the Combined Context File

Run `m1f` from your terminal, pointing to your input file list and specifying an
output file. It's recommended to use the `MachineReadable` separator style.

```bash
m1f \
  --input-file my_wp_context_files.txt \
  --output-file .gen/wordpress_context.m1f.txt \
  --separator-style MachineReadable \
  --force \
  --minimal-output
```

**Explanation of options:**

- `--input-file my_wp_context_files.txt`: Specifies the list of files to
  include.
- `--output-file .gen/wordpress_context.m1f.txt`: Defines where the combined
  file will be saved. Using a `.gen` or `.ai-context` subfolder is good
  practice.
- `--separator-style MachineReadable`: Ensures the output is easily parsable by
  AI tools.
- `--force`: Overwrites the output file if it already exists.
- `--minimal-output`: Prevents the script from generating auxiliary files like
  file lists or logs, keeping your project clean.

You can also generate only the auxiliary files (file list and directory list)
without creating the combined file:

```bash
m1f \
  --input-file my_wp_context_files.txt \
  --output-file .gen/wordpress_auxiliary_only.m1f.txt \
  --skip-output-file \
  --verbose
```

This will create `wordpress_auxiliary_only_filelist.txt` and
`wordpress_auxiliary_only_dirlist.txt` files but won't generate the combined
content file.

### 4. Using the Context File with Your AI Assistant

Once `wordpress_context.m1f.txt` is generated:

1.  Open the file in your AI-enabled editor (e.g., Cursor, VS Code with AI
    extensions).
2.  Use your editor's features to add this file to the AI's context. For
    example, in Cursor, you can type `@wordpress_context.m1f.txt` in the chat or
    use the "Add to Context" option.
3.  Now, when you ask the AI questions or request code related to your WordPress
    theme/plugin, it will have the specific context of your selected files.

### Example: Creating a VS Code Task

You can automate this process by creating a VS Code task in your
`.vscode/tasks.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "WordPress: Generate AI Context from List",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/tools/m1f.py",
        "--input-file",
        "${workspaceFolder}/my_wp_context_files.txt",
        "--output-file",
        "${workspaceFolder}/.gen/wordpress_context.m1f.txt",
        "--separator-style",
        "MachineReadable",
        "--force",
        "--minimal-output",
        "--quiet"
      ],
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "detail": "Combines specified WordPress theme/plugin files into a single context file for AI."
    },
    {
      "label": "WordPress: Generate File Lists Only",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/tools/m1f.py",
        "--input-file",
        "${workspaceFolder}/my_wp_context_files.txt",
        "--output-file",
        "${workspaceFolder}/.gen/wordpress_auxiliary.m1f.txt",
        "--skip-output-file",
        "--verbose"
      ],
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": "build",
      "detail": "Generates file and directory lists without creating the combined file."
    }
  ]
}
```

With this task, you can simply run "WordPress: Generate AI Context from List"
from the VS Code Command Palette to update your context file. Remember to
maintain your `my_wp_context_files.txt` list as your project evolves.

This approach helps you provide targeted and relevant information to your AI
assistant, leading to more accurate and helpful responses for your WordPress
development tasks.

## Example: Organizing a Large Project with `m1f`

When dealing with a project that contains hundreds or thousands of files, start
by generating a complete file and directory listing without creating the merged
context file. Run the **Project Review: Generate Lists** task. It calls `m1f`
with `--skip-output-file` and saves two inventory files to the `m1f` directory:

- `m1f/project_review_filelist.txt`
- `m1f/project_review_dirlist.txt`

Review these lists and decide which areas of the project you want to load into
your AI assistant. Typical numbered context files might include:

- `1_doc.txt` – the full documentation bundle
- `2_template.txt` – template files from your theme
- `3_plugin.txt` – a specific plugin or a group of plugins

Store each generated context file in the `m1f` folder with a number prefix for
quick referencing in Windsurf, Cursor, or Claude (for example `@m1f/1_doc.txt`).

To keep the inventory current during development, launch **Project Review: Watch
for Changes**. This background watcher reruns the list generation whenever files
are modified.

Remember to add `m1f/` (and `.1f/` if used) to your `.gitignore` so these helper
files stay out of version control.

======= docs/01_m1f/00_m1f.md ======
# m1f (Make One File)

A modern, high-performance tool that combines multiple files into a single file
with rich metadata, content deduplication, and async I/O support.

## Overview

The m1f tool (v3.4.0) solves a common challenge when working with LLMs:
providing sufficient context without exceeding token limits. Built with Python
3.10+ and modern architecture patterns, it creates optimized reference files
from multiple sources while automatically handling duplicates and providing
comprehensive metadata.

## Key Features

- **Content Deduplication**: Automatically detects and skips duplicate files
  based on SHA256 checksums
- **Async I/O**: High-performance file operations with concurrent processing
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations throughout the codebase
- **Modern Architecture**: Modular package structure with clean separation of
  concerns
- **Smart Filtering**: Advanced file filtering with size limits, extensions, and
  patterns
- **Symlink Support**: Intelligent symlink handling with cycle detection
- **Professional Security**: Integration with detect-secrets for sensitive data
  detection
- **Colorized Output**: Beautiful console output with progress indicators

## Quick Start

### Initialize m1f in Your Project

```bash
# Quick setup for any project
cd /your/project
m1f-init

# Initialize without creating symlink to m1f documentation
m1f-init --no-symlink

# This creates in the m1f/ directory:
# - <project>_complete.txt          # Full project bundle
# - <project>_complete_filelist.txt # List of all included files
# - <project>_complete_dirlist.txt  # List of all directories
# - <project>_docs.txt              # Documentation bundle
# - <project>_docs_filelist.txt    # List of documentation files
# - <project>_docs_dirlist.txt     # Documentation directories
# - .m1f.config.yml                # Configuration file
```

### Basic m1f Commands

```bash
# Basic usage with a source directory
m1f -s ./your_project -o ./combined.txt

# Include only specific file types
m1f -s ./your_project -o ./combined.txt --include-extensions .py .js .md

# Include only documentation files (62 extensions)
m1f -s ./your_project -o ./docs_bundle.txt --docs-only

# Exclude specific directories
m1f -s ./your_project -o ./combined.txt --excludes "node_modules/" "build/" "dist/"

# Filter by file size (new in v2.0.0)
m1f -s ./your_project -o ./combined.txt --max-file-size 50KB
```

## Preset System

The preset system allows you to define file-specific processing rules for
different file types within the same bundle. This is particularly useful for
projects with mixed content types.

### Preset Hierarchy

Presets are loaded in the following order (highest priority wins):

1. **Global Presets** (~/.m1f/global-presets.yml) - Lowest priority
2. **User Presets** (~/.m1f/presets/\*.yml) - Medium priority
3. **Project Presets** (via --preset parameter) - Highest priority

### Quick Preset Examples

```bash
# Use built-in WordPress preset
m1f -s ./wp-site -o bundle.txt --preset presets/wordpress.m1f-presets.yml

# Use specific preset group
m1f -s ./project -o bundle.txt --preset my-presets.yml --preset-group production

# Load multiple preset files (merged in order)
m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset defaults.yml project.yml overrides.yml
```

### Available Processing Actions

- **minify** - Remove unnecessary whitespace (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **strip_tags** - Remove specified HTML tags
- **strip_comments** - Remove comments based on file type
- **compress_whitespace** - Normalize whitespace
- **remove_empty_lines** - Remove all empty lines
- **custom** - Apply custom processors

For detailed preset documentation, see:

- [Preset System Guide](02_m1f_presets.md) - Complete preset documentation
- [Per-File-Type Settings](03_m1f_preset_per_file_settings.md) - File-specific
  overrides

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations

```bash
# Basic command using a source directory
m1f --source-directory /path/to/your/code \
  --output-file /path/to/combined_output.txt

# Using multiple source directories (new in v3.4.0)
m1f -s ./src -s ./docs -s ./tests -o combined_output.txt

# Using an input file containing paths to process (one per line)
m1f -i filelist.txt -o combined_output.txt

# Using both source directory and input file together
m1f -s ./source_code -i ./file_list.txt -o ./combined.txt

# Using include patterns to filter files (new in v3.4.0)
m1f -s ./project -o output.txt --includes "src/**" "*.py" "!*_test.py"

# Combining includes with extensions for precise filtering
m1f -s ./project -o docs.txt --include-extensions .md .rst \
  --includes "docs/**" "README.md"

# Remove scraped metadata from HTML2MD files (new in v2.0.0)
m1f -s ./scraped_docs -o ./clean_docs.txt \
  --include-extensions .md --remove-scraped-metadata
```

### Advanced Operations

```bash
# Using MachineReadable style with verbose logging
m1f -s ./my_project -o ./output/bundle.m1f.txt \
  --separator-style MachineReadable --force --verbose

# Creating a combined file and a backup zip archive
m1f -s ./source_code -o ./dist/combined.txt \
  --create-archive --archive-type zip

# Only include text files under 50KB to avoid large generated files
m1f -s ./project -o ./text_only.txt \
  --max-file-size 50KB --include-extensions .py .js .md .txt .json

# Handle symlinks with cycle detection (new in v2.0.0)
m1f -s ./project -o ./output.txt \
  --include-symlinks --verbose
```

## Security Check

The `--security-check` option scans files for potential secrets using
`detect-secrets` if the library is installed. When secrets are detected you can
decide how the script proceeds:

- `abort` – stop processing immediately and do not create the output file.
- `skip` – omit files that contain secrets from the final output.
- `warn` – include all files but print a summary warning at the end.

If `detect-secrets` is not available, a simplified pattern-based scan is used as
a fallback.

## Output Files

By default, `m1f.py` creates several output files to provide comprehensive
information about the processed files:

1. **Primary output file** - The combined file specified by `--output-file`
   containing all processed files with separators
2. **Log file** - A `.log` file with the same base name as the output file,
   containing detailed processing information
3. **File list** - A `_filelist.txt` file containing the paths of all included
   files
4. **Directory list** - A `_dirlist.txt` file containing all unique directories
   from the included files
5. **Archive file** - An optional backup archive (zip or tar.gz) if
   `--create-archive` is specified

To create only the primary output file and skip the auxiliary files, use the
`--minimal-output` option:

```bash
# Create only the combined output file without any auxiliary files
m1f -s ./src -o ./combined.txt --minimal-output
```

## Common Use Cases

### Documentation Compilation

```bash
# Create a complete documentation bundle from all markdown files
m1f -s ./docs -o ./doc_bundle.m1f.txt --include-extensions .md
```

### Code Review Preparation

```bash
# Bundle specific components for code review
m1f -i code_review_files.txt -o ./review_bundle.m1f.txt
```

### WordPress Development

```bash
# Combine theme or plugin files for AI analysis
m1f -s ./wp-content/themes/my-theme -o ./theme_context.m1f.txt \
  --include-extensions .php .js .css --exclude-paths-file ./exclude_build_files.txt
```

### Project Knowledge Base

```bash
# Create a searchable knowledge base from project documentation
m1f -s ./project -o ./knowledge_base.m1f.txt \
  --include-extensions .md .txt .rst --minimal-output
```

### Documentation Bundles

```bash
# Create a documentation-only bundle using --docs-only
m1f -s ./project -o ./docs_bundle.txt --docs-only

# Equivalent using include-extensions (more verbose)
m1f -s ./project -o ./docs_bundle.txt --include-extensions \
  .1 .1st .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .adoc .asciidoc .changelog .changes \
  .creole .faq .feature .help .history .info .lhs .litcoffee .ltx \
  .man .markdown .markdown2 .md .mdown .mdtxt .mdtext .mdwn .mdx \
  .me .mkd .mkdn .mkdown .ms .news .nfo .notes .org .pod .pod6 \
  .qmd .rd .rdoc .readme .release .rmd .roff .rst .rtf .story \
  .t .tex .texi .texinfo .text .textile .todo .tr .txt .wiki
```

### HTML2MD Integration

```bash
# Combine scraped markdown files and remove metadata
m1f -s ./scraped_content -o ./clean_content.m1f.txt \
  --include-extensions .md --remove-scraped-metadata

# Merge multiple scraped websites into a clean documentation bundle
m1f -s ./web_content -o ./web_docs.m1f.txt \
  --include-extensions .md --remove-scraped-metadata --separator-style Markdown
```

### Project Analysis and Overview

```bash
# Generate complete project file and directory lists for analysis
m1f -s . -o m1f/project_analysis.txt --skip-output-file \
  --exclude-paths-file .gitignore --excludes m1f/

# This creates (without the main output file):
# - m1f/project_analysis_filelist.txt  # All project files
# - m1f/project_analysis_dirlist.txt   # All directories
# - m1f/project_analysis.log           # Processing log
```

Use this when you need:

- A complete overview of your project structure
- To understand what files m1f will process
- To verify your exclusion patterns are working correctly
- To analyze project composition before creating bundles
- Input for m1f-claude --init to create optimal configurations

The file lists respect all m1f defaults (excluding .git, node_modules, etc.)
plus your .gitignore patterns.

## Output Files

### Main Output File

The primary output specified with `-o` contains the combined content of all
processed files.

### Auxiliary Files (Automatically Generated)

For each m1f operation, auxiliary files are automatically created alongside the
main output file:

1. **File List** (`<output>_filelist.txt`)

   - Complete list of all files included in the bundle
   - One file path per line
   - Useful for:
     - Understanding what's in your bundle
     - Creating custom file lists for specific m1f operations
     - Input for other tools or scripts
     - Selective inclusion/exclusion in future bundles

2. **Directory List** (`<output>_dirlist.txt`)

   - Complete list of all directories containing processed files
   - One directory path per line
   - Useful for:
     - Understanding project structure
     - Identifying which directories to include/exclude
     - Creating directory-specific bundles

3. **Processing Log** (`<output>.log`)
   - Detailed processing information
   - Includes timing, errors, and statistics

### Working with File Lists

The generated file lists can be edited and used as input for subsequent m1f
operations:

```bash
# Initial project analysis
m1f-init
# Creates: m1f/<project>_complete_filelist.txt and m1f/<project>_docs_filelist.txt

# Edit the file list to remove unwanted files
vi m1f/myproject_complete_filelist.txt

# Use the edited list for a custom bundle
m1f -i m1f/myproject_complete_filelist.txt -o m1f/custom_bundle.txt

# Combine multiple file lists
cat m1f/*_filelist.txt | sort -u > m1f/all_files.txt
m1f -i m1f/all_files.txt -o m1f/combined.txt
```

### Disabling Auxiliary Files

Use `--minimal-output` to create only the main output file without auxiliary
files:

```bash
m1f -s . -o output.txt --minimal-output
```

## Separator Styles

The `--separator-style` option allows you to choose how files are separated in
the combined output file. Each style is designed for specific use cases, from
human readability to automated parsing.

### Standard Style

A simple, concise separator that shows only the file path:

```
======= path/to/file.py ======
```

### Detailed Style (Default)

A more comprehensive separator that includes file metadata:

```
========================================================================================
== FILE: path/to/file.py
== DATE: 2025-05-15 14:30:21 | SIZE: 2.50 KB | TYPE: .py
== CHECKSUM_SHA256: abcdef1234567890...
========================================================================================
```

### Markdown Style

Formats the metadata as Markdown with proper code blocks, using the file
extension to set syntax highlighting:

````markdown
## path/to/file.py

**Date Modified:** 2025-05-15 14:30:21 | **Size:** 2.50 KB | **Type:** .py |
**Checksum (SHA256):** abcdef1234567890...

```python
# File content starts here
def example():
    return "Hello, world!"
```
````

### MachineReadable Style

A robust format designed for reliable automated parsing and processing:

```text
--- PYMK1F_BEGIN_FILE_METADATA_BLOCK_12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc ---
METADATA_JSON:
{
    "original_filepath": "path/to/file.py",
    "original_filename": "file.py",
    "timestamp_utc_iso": "2025-05-15T14:30:21Z",
    "type": ".py",
    "size_bytes": 2560,
    "checksum_sha256": "abcdef1234567890..."
}
--- PYMK1F_END_FILE_METADATA_BLOCK_12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc ---
--- PYMK1F_BEGIN_FILE_CONTENT_BLOCK_12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc ---

# File content here

--- PYMK1F_END_FILE_CONTENT_BLOCK_12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc ---
```

### None Style

Files are concatenated directly without any separators between them.

## Additional Notes

### Binary File Handling

While the script can include binary files using the `--include-binary-files`
option, these are read as text (UTF-8 with error ignoring). This can result in
garbled/unreadable content in the output and significantly increase file size.

### Encoding Behavior

The script uses UTF-8 as the default encoding for reading and writing files.
When using `--convert-to-charset`, the original encoding of each file is
automatically detected and recorded in the file metadata.

### Documentation File Extensions

m1f recognizes the following extensions as documentation files:

- Man pages: .1, .1st, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8
- Markup formats: .adoc, .asciidoc, .md, .markdown, .mdx, .rst, .org, .textile,
  .wiki
- Text formats: .txt, .text, .readme, .changelog, .changes, .todo, .notes
- Developer docs: .pod, .rdoc, .yard, .lhs, .litcoffee
- LaTeX/TeX: .tex, .ltx, .texi, .texinfo
- Other: .rtf, .nfo, .faq, .help, .history, .info, .news, .release, .story

When `--prefer-utf8-for-text-files` is enabled (default), m1f prefers UTF-8
encoding for:

- All Markdown variants (.md, .markdown, .mdx, .rmd, .qmd, etc.)
- Plain text files (.txt, .text, .readme, .changelog, .todo, etc.)
- Structured text formats (.rst, .org, .textile, .wiki, etc.)
- Developer documentation (.pod, .rdoc, .lhs, .litcoffee, etc.)

### Line Ending Behavior

The `--line-ending` option only affects the line endings generated by the script
(in separators and blank lines), not those in the original files. The line
endings of original files remain unchanged.

### Archive Creation

When `--create-archive` is used, the archive will contain all files selected for
inclusion in the main output file, using their relative paths within the
archive.

### Architecture

The m1f tool has been completely rewritten as a modular Python package:

```
tools/m1f/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization
├── cli.py               # Command-line interface
├── core.py              # Main orchestration logic
├── config.py            # Configuration management
├── constants.py         # Constants and enums
├── exceptions.py        # Custom exceptions
├── file_processor.py    # File handling with async I/O
├── encoding_handler.py  # Smart encoding detection
├── security_scanner.py  # Secret detection integration
├── output_writer.py     # Output generation
├── archive_creator.py   # Archive functionality
├── separator_generator.py # Separator formatting
├── logging.py           # Structured logging
└── utils.py             # Utility functions
```

### Performance Considerations

With the new async I/O architecture, m1f can handle large projects more
efficiently:

- Concurrent file reading and processing
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Smart caching to avoid redundant operations
- Content deduplication saves space and processing time

For extremely large directories with tens of thousands of files or very large
individual files, the script might take some time to process.

## Preset System

The preset system provides powerful file-specific processing capabilities:

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Configuration**: Settings cascade from global → project → CLI
- **File-Type Processing**: Apply different rules to different file extensions
- **Processing Actions**:
  - `minify` - Reduce file size by removing unnecessary characters
  - `strip_tags` - Remove HTML tags
  - `strip_comments` - Remove code comments
  - `compress_whitespace` - Reduce multiple spaces/newlines
  - `remove_empty_lines` - Clean up empty lines
- **Per-File Settings**: Override security, size limits, and filters per file
  type
- **Custom Processors**: Extend with your own processing functions

### Quick Start

1. Create a preset file in your project (`.m1f-presets.yml`):

```yaml
globals:
  global_settings:
    include_extensions: [.js, .css, .html, .php]
    security_check: warn
    max_file_size: 1MB

  presets:
    frontend:
      extensions: [.js, .css, .html]
      actions: [minify]

    backend:
      extensions: [.php]
      security_check: fail
      max_file_size: 500KB
```

2. Use the preset:

```bash
m1f -s ./src -o output.txt --preset .m1f-presets.yml
```

# m1f Quick Reference

## Most Common Commands

### Basic File Combination

```bash
# Combine all files in current directory
m1f -s . -o output.txt

# Combine specific directory
m1f -s ./src -o bundle.txt

# Force overwrite existing output
m1f -s . -o output.txt -f
```

### Using Presets (v3.2.0+)

```bash
# Use a preset file (can define ALL parameters)
m1f --preset production.yml -o output.txt

# Preset can even define source and output
m1f --preset full-config.yml

# Override preset values with CLI
m1f --preset prod.yml -o custom-output.txt -v
```

### File Type Filtering

```bash
# Only Python files
m1f -s . -o code.txt --include-extensions .py

# Multiple file types
m1f -s . -o docs.txt --include-extensions .md .txt .rst

# Exclude certain types
m1f -s . -o output.txt --exclude-extensions .pyc .log
```

### Directory and Pattern Exclusions

```bash
# Exclude specific directories
m1f -s . -o output.txt --excludes "tests/" "docs/"

# Exclude patterns
m1f -s . -o output.txt --excludes "*.test.js" "*/tmp/*"

# Use gitignore file
m1f -s . -o output.txt --exclude-paths-file .gitignore
```

### Output Formatting

```bash
# Markdown format
m1f -s . -o output.md --separator-style Markdown

# Machine-readable JSON metadata
m1f -s . -o output.txt --separator-style MachineReadable

# No separators
m1f -s . -o output.txt --separator-style None
```

### Size Management

```bash
# Skip large files
m1f -s . -o output.txt --max-file-size 100KB

# Include only small text files
m1f -s . -o small.txt --max-file-size 50KB --include-extensions .txt .md
```

### Archive Creation

```bash
# Create zip backup
m1f -s . -o output.txt --create-archive

# Create tar.gz backup
m1f -s . -o output.txt --create-archive --archive-type tar.gz
```

### Using Presets

```bash
# Use single preset
m1f -s . -o output.txt --preset wordpress.m1f-presets.yml

# Use preset group
m1f -s . -o output.txt --preset web.yml --preset-group frontend

# Multiple presets (merged in order)
m1f -s . -o output.txt --preset base.yml project.yml
```

## Common Patterns

### Documentation Bundle

```bash
m1f -s ./docs -o documentation.txt \
    --include-extensions .md .rst .txt \
    --separator-style Markdown
```

### Source Code Bundle

```bash
m1f -s ./src -o source-code.txt \
    --include-extensions .py .js .ts .jsx .tsx \
    --excludes "*.test.*" "*.spec.*" \
    --max-file-size 500KB
```

### WordPress Theme/Plugin

```bash
m1f -s ./wp-content/themes/mytheme -o theme.txt \
    --include-extensions .php .js .css \
    --excludes "node_modules/" "vendor/" \
    --preset presets/wordpress.m1f-presets.yml
```

### Clean Documentation Export

```bash
m1f -s ./scraped_docs -o clean-docs.txt \
    --include-extensions .md \
    --remove-scraped-metadata \
    --separator-style Markdown
```

### Multiple Exclude/Include Files

```bash
# Multiple exclude files (merged)
m1f -s . -o output.txt \
    --exclude-paths-file .gitignore .dockerignore custom-excludes.txt

# Whitelist mode with include files
m1f -s . -o api-bundle.txt \
    --include-paths-file api-files.txt core-files.txt \
    --exclude-paths-file .gitignore
```

### Working with File Lists (-i)

```bash
# Single input file
m1f -s . -i files.txt -o output.txt

# Merge multiple file lists (Bash)
m1f -s . -i <(cat critical.txt important.txt nice-to-have.txt) -o output.txt

# Combine with filters (input files bypass filters)
m1f -s . -i must-include.txt -o output.txt \
    --exclude-paths-file .gitignore
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Create timestamped output
m1f -s . -o build.txt -t

# Minimal output for automation
m1f -s . -o output.txt --minimal-output --quiet

# With security check
m1f -s . -o output.txt --security-check abort
```

```

## General Options

### `--help`, `-h`

Show help message and exit.

### `--version`

Show program version and exit. Current version: v3.4.0

## Input/Output Options

### `--source-directory DIR`, `-s DIR`

Path to the directory containing files to combine. Can be used multiple times to
process multiple directories.

### `--input-file FILE`, `-i FILE`

Path to a text file containing a list of files/directories to process, one per
line. These files are explicitly included and bypass all filter rules.

**Note**: At least one of `-s` (source directory) or `-i` (input file) must be
specified. When using `-i` alone, relative paths in the input file are resolved
relative to the current working directory. When both `-s` and `-i` are used,
relative paths in the input file are resolved relative to the source directory.

Example input file:

```
# Comments are supported
src/main.py          # Relative to source directory
/absolute/path.txt   # Absolute path
docs/**/*.md         # Glob patterns supported
```

**Merging multiple file lists with Bash**:

```bash
# Create temporary merged file
cat files1.txt files2.txt files3.txt > merged_files.txt
m1f -s . -i merged_files.txt -o output.txt

# Or use process substitution (Linux/Mac)
m1f -s . -i <(cat files1.txt files2.txt files3.txt) -o output.txt

# Remove duplicates while merging
m1f -s . -i <(cat files1.txt files2.txt | sort -u) -o output.txt
```

### `--output-file FILE`, `-o FILE` (REQUIRED)

Path where the combined output file will be created. This is the only required
parameter.

### `--input-include-files [FILE ...]`

Files to include at the beginning of the output. The first file is treated as an
introduction/header.

## Output Formatting

### `--separator-style {Standard,Detailed,Markdown,MachineReadable,None}`

Format of the separator between files. Default: `Detailed`

- **Standard**: Simple separator with filename
- **Detailed**: Includes file metadata (date, size, type, checksum)
- **Markdown**: Markdown-formatted headers and metadata
- **MachineReadable**: JSON metadata blocks for programmatic parsing
- **None**: No separators (files concatenated directly)

### `--line-ending {lf,crlf}`

Line ending style for generated content. Default: `lf`

- **lf**: Unix/Linux/Mac style (\n)
- **crlf**: Windows style (\r\n)

### `--add-timestamp`, `-t`

Add timestamp to output filename in format `_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`.

### `--filename-mtime-hash`

Add hash of file modification times to output filename. Useful for
cache-busting.

## File Filtering

### `--excludes [PATTERN ...]`

Paths, directories, or glob patterns to exclude. Supports wildcards.

Example: `--excludes "*/tests/*" "*.pyc" "node_modules/"`

### `--exclude-paths-file FILE ...`

File(s) containing paths to exclude (supports gitignore format). Each pattern on
a new line. Multiple files can be specified and will be merged. Non-existent
files are skipped gracefully.

Examples:

```bash
# Single file
m1f -s . -o output.txt --exclude-paths-file .gitignore

# Multiple files
m1f -s . -o output.txt --exclude-paths-file .gitignore .m1fignore custom-excludes.txt
```

### `--include-paths-file FILE ...`

File(s) containing patterns to include (supports gitignore format). When
specified, only files matching these patterns will be included (whitelist mode).
Multiple files can be specified and will be merged. Non-existent files are
skipped gracefully.

**Processing Order**:

1. Files from `-i` (input-file) are always included, bypassing all filters
2. Files from `-s` (source directory) are filtered by include patterns first
3. Then exclude patterns are applied

**Path Resolution**: Same as `-i` - relative paths are resolved relative to the
source directory (`-s`).

Example include file:

```
# Include all Python files
*.py
# Include specific directories
src/**/*
api/**/*
# Exclude tests even if they match above
!test_*.py
```

Examples:

```bash
# Single file
m1f -s . -o output.txt --include-paths-file important-files.txt

# Multiple files
m1f -s . -o output.txt --include-paths-file core-files.txt api-files.txt

# Combined with input file (input file takes precedence)
m1f -s . -i explicit-files.txt -o output.txt --include-paths-file patterns.txt
```

### `--include-extensions [EXT ...]`

Only include files with these extensions. Extensions should include the dot.

Example: `--include-extensions .py .js .md`

### `--exclude-extensions [EXT ...]`

Exclude files with these extensions.

Example: `--exclude-extensions .pyc .pyo`

### `--include-dot-paths`

Include files and directories starting with a dot (hidden files). By default,
these are excluded.

### `--include-binary-files`

Attempt to include binary files. Use with caution as this may produce unreadable
output.

### `--include-symlinks`

Follow symbolic links. Be careful of infinite loops!

### `--max-file-size SIZE`

Skip files larger than specified size. Supports KB, MB, GB suffixes.

Examples: `10KB`, `1.5MB`, `2GB`

### `--no-default-excludes`

Disable default exclusions. By default, m1f excludes:

- `.git/`, `.svn/`, `.hg/`
- `node_modules/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`
- `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`

### `--remove-scraped-metadata`

Remove scraped metadata (URL, timestamp) from HTML2MD files during processing.
Useful when processing scraped content.

## Character Encoding

### `--convert-to-charset {utf-8,utf-16,utf-16-le,utf-16-be,ascii,latin-1,cp1252}`

Convert all files to specified encoding. Default behavior is to detect and
preserve original encoding.

### `--abort-on-encoding-error`

Abort if encoding conversion fails. By default, files with encoding errors are
skipped with a warning.

### `--no-prefer-utf8-for-text-files`

Disable UTF-8 preference for text files (.md, .txt, .rst) when encoding is
ambiguous. By default, m1f prefers UTF-8 encoding for these file types when
chardet detects windows-1252 with less than 95% confidence, as these files often
contain UTF-8 emojis or special characters.

## Security Options

### `--security-check {error,warn,skip}`

Check for sensitive information in files using detect-secrets.

- **error**: Stop processing if secrets are found (default in v3.2)
- **warn**: Include files but show warnings
- **skip**: Disable security scanning (not recommended)

## Archive Options

### `--create-archive`

Create backup archive of processed files in addition to the combined output.

### `--archive-type {zip,tar.gz}`

Type of archive to create. Default: `zip`

## Output Control

### `--force`, `-f`

Force overwrite of existing output file without prompting.

### `--minimal-output`

Only create the combined file (no auxiliary files like file lists or directory
structure).

### `--skip-output-file`

Skip creating the main output file. Useful when only creating an archive.

### `--allow-duplicate-files`

Allow files with identical content to be included in the output. By default, m1f
deduplicates files based on their content checksum to save space and tokens.
With this flag, all files are included even if they have identical content.

### `--verbose`, `-v`

Enable verbose output with detailed processing information.

### `--quiet`, `-q`

Suppress all console output except errors.

## Preset Configuration

### `--preset FILE [FILE ...]`

Load preset configuration file(s) for file-specific processing. Multiple files
are merged in order.

### `--preset-group GROUP`

Use a specific preset group from the configuration file.

### `--disable-presets`

Disable all preset processing, even if preset files are specified.

## Exit Codes

- **0**: Success
- **1**: General error (M1FError base)
- **2**: File not found (FileNotFoundError)
- **3**: Permission denied (PermissionError)
- **4**: Encoding error (EncodingError)
- **5**: Configuration error (ConfigurationError)
- **6**: Validation error (ValidationError)
- **7**: Security check failed (SecurityError)
- **8**: Archive creation failed (ArchiveError)
- **130**: Operation cancelled by user (Ctrl+C)

## Environment Variables

**Note**: The following environment variables are documented for future
implementation but are not currently supported in v3.4.0:

- `M1F_DEFAULT_PRESET` - Path to default preset file (not implemented)
- `M1F_SECURITY_CHECK` - Default security check mode (not implemented)
- `M1F_MAX_FILE_SIZE` - Default maximum file size limit (not implemented)

## Subcommands

### `auto-bundle`

Create multiple m1f bundles based on a YAML configuration file
(`.m1f.config.yml`).

```bash
# Create all bundles
m1f auto-bundle

# Create specific bundle
m1f auto-bundle BUNDLE_NAME

# List available bundles
m1f auto-bundle --list

# With options
m1f auto-bundle --verbose
m1f auto-bundle --quiet
```

**Note**: The `m1f-update` command is a convenient alias for `m1f auto-bundle`
that can be used interchangeably:

```bash
# These are equivalent:
m1f auto-bundle
m1f-update

# With specific bundle:
m1f auto-bundle code
m1f-update code
```

**Options:**

- `BUNDLE_NAME`: Name of specific bundle to create (optional)
- `--list`: List available bundles from configuration
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Enable verbose output
- `--quiet`, `-q`: Suppress all console output

See the [Auto Bundle Guide](20_auto_bundle_guide.md) for detailed configuration
instructions.

## Notes

1. **Module Invocation**: You can use either `m1f` or `python -m tools.m1f`, or
   set up the `m1f` alias as described in the development workflow.

2. **Input Requirements**: At least one of `-s` (source directory) or `-i`
   (input file) must be specified. If neither is provided, m1f will show an
   error message.

3. **Gitignore**: m1f respects .gitignore files by default unless
   `--no-default-excludes` is used.

4. **Performance**: For large projects, use `--include-extensions` to limit
   processing to specific file types.

======= docs/01_m1f/03_troubleshooting.md ======
# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues and error messages you might encounter when
using m1f.

## Common Issues

### Module Import Error

**Problem**: Running `m1f` results in:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'm1f'
```

**Solution**: Use the direct script invocation instead:

```bash
m1f [options]
```

Or set up the alias as described in the
[Development Workflow](./21_development_workflow.md).

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: Error when trying to write output file:

```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/path/to/output.txt'
```

**Solutions**:

1. Check write permissions in the output directory
2. Use a different output location
3. Run with appropriate permissions (avoid using sudo unless necessary)

### File Not Found

**Problem**: Source directory or input file not found.

**Solutions**:

1. Verify the path exists: `ls -la /path/to/source`
2. Use absolute paths to avoid confusion
3. Check for typos in the path

### Encoding Errors

**Problem**: `UnicodeDecodeError` when processing files.

**Solutions**:

1. Use `--convert-to-charset utf-8` to force UTF-8 encoding
2. Skip problematic files with proper exclusion patterns
3. Use `--abort-on-encoding-error` to identify problematic files

Example:

```bash
m1f -s . -o output.txt --convert-to-charset utf-8
```

### Memory Issues with Large Projects

**Problem**: Memory usage is too high or process is killed.

**Solutions**:

1. Use `--max-file-size` to limit individual file sizes
2. Process specific directories instead of entire project
3. Use `--include-extensions` to limit file types
4. Enable minimal output mode: `--minimal-output`

Example:

```bash
m1f -s . -o output.txt --max-file-size 1MB --include-extensions .py .md
```

### Symlink Cycles

**Problem**: Infinite loop when following symlinks.

**Solutions**:

1. Don't use `--include-symlinks` unless necessary
2. Exclude directories with circular symlinks
3. m1f has built-in cycle detection, but it's better to avoid the issue

### Security Check Failures

**Problem**: Files contain sensitive information.

**Solutions**:

1. Review the detected secrets
2. Use `--security-check skip` to skip files with secrets
3. Use `--security-check warn` to include but get warnings
4. Add sensitive files to exclusions

Example:

```bash
m1f -s . -o output.txt --security-check warn --excludes ".env" "config/secrets.yml"
```

## Error Messages

### "Output file already exists"

**Meaning**: The specified output file exists and would be overwritten.

**Solution**: Use `-f` or `--force` to overwrite, or choose a different output
filename.

### "No files found to process"

**Meaning**: No files matched the inclusion criteria.

**Solutions**:

1. Check your source directory contains files
2. Verify extension filters aren't too restrictive
3. Check exclusion patterns aren't excluding everything
4. Use `--verbose` to see what's being processed

### "File size exceeds maximum allowed"

**Meaning**: A file is larger than the specified `--max-file-size`.

**Solution**: The file is automatically skipped. Adjust `--max-file-size` if
needed.

### "Failed to create archive"

**Meaning**: Archive creation failed (disk space, permissions, etc.).

**Solutions**:

1. Check available disk space
2. Verify write permissions
3. Try a different archive format
4. Skip archive creation and create output file only

### "Preset file not found"

**Meaning**: The specified preset configuration file doesn't exist.

**Solutions**:

1. Check the preset file path
2. Use absolute paths for preset files
3. Verify preset file exists: `ls -la presets/`

## Performance Optimization

### Slow Processing

**Solutions**:

1. Use `--include-extensions` to limit file types
2. Exclude large directories like `node_modules`
3. Use `--max-file-size` to skip large files
4. Enable minimal output: `--minimal-output`
5. Disable security checks if not needed

### High Memory Usage

**Solutions**:

1. Process smaller directory trees
2. Use file size limits
3. Exclude binary files
4. Process in batches using input file lists

## Debug Mode

For detailed debugging information:

```bash
m1f -s . -o output.txt --verbose
```

This will show:

- Files being processed
- Files being skipped and why
- Processing times
- Detailed error messages

## Getting Help

1. Check the [CLI Reference](./02_cli_reference.md) for parameter details
2. Review [examples in the main documentation](00_m1f.md#common-use-cases)
3. Check the [preset documentation](./10_m1f_presets.md) for configuration
   issues
4. Report issues at the project repository

## Exit Codes

Understanding exit codes can help in scripting:

- `0`: Success
- `1`: General error
- `2`: Invalid arguments
- `3`: File not found
- `4`: Permission denied
- `5`: Security check failed

Use in scripts:

```bash
if m1f -s . -o output.txt; then
    echo "Success"
else
    echo "Failed with exit code: $?"
fi
```

======= docs/01_m1f/10_m1f_presets.md ======
# m1f Preset System Documentation

The m1f preset system allows you to define file-specific processing rules,
enabling different handling for different file types within the same bundle.

## Overview

Instead of applying the same settings to all files, presets let you:

- Minify HTML files while preserving source code formatting
- Strip comments from production code but keep them in documentation
- Apply different separator styles for different file types
- Truncate large data files while keeping full source code
- **NEW**: Override security checks and size limits per file type
- **NEW**: Integrate with auto-bundling for intelligent project organization

## Quick Start

1. **Use a built-in preset**:

   ```bash
   m1f -s ./my-project -o bundle.txt --preset presets/wordpress.m1f-presets.yml
   ```

2. **Specify a preset group**:

   ```bash
   m1f -s ./site -o bundle.txt --preset presets/web-project.m1f-presets.yml --preset-group frontend
   ```

3. **Use multiple preset files**:
   ```bash
   m1f -s . -o bundle.txt --preset company-presets.yml project-presets.yml
   ```

## Preset Configuration File

Preset files are YAML documents that define processing rules:

```yaml
# Group name
my_project:
  description: "Processing rules for my project"
  enabled: true
  priority: 10 # Higher priority groups are checked first
  base_path: "src" # Optional base path for patterns

  presets:
    # Preset for Python files
    python:
      extensions: [".py"]
      patterns:
        - "*.py"
        - "lib/**/*.py"
      actions:
        - strip_comments
        - remove_empty_lines
      separator_style: "Detailed"
      include_metadata: true

    # Preset for HTML files
    html:
      extensions: [".html", ".htm"]
      actions:
        - minify
        - strip_tags
      strip_tags: ["script", "style"]
      preserve_tags: ["pre", "code"]
      max_lines: 500 # Truncate after 500 lines

    # Default preset for unmatched files
    default:
      actions: []
      include_metadata: true
```

## Available Actions

### Built-in Actions

1. **`minify`** - Reduces file size by removing unnecessary whitespace

   - HTML: Removes comments, compresses whitespace
   - CSS: Removes comments, compresses rules
   - JS: Basic minification (removes comments and newlines)

2. **`strip_tags`** - Removes HTML tags

   - Use `strip_tags` to list tags to remove
   - Use `preserve_tags` to protect specific tags

3. **`strip_comments`** - Removes comments based on file type

   - Python: Removes # comments (preserves docstrings)
   - JS/Java/C/C++: Removes // and /\* \*/ comments

4. **`compress_whitespace`** - Normalizes whitespace

   - Replaces multiple spaces with single space
   - Reduces multiple newlines to double newline

5. **`remove_empty_lines`** - Removes all empty lines

6. **`custom`** - Apply custom processor
   - Specify processor with `custom_processor`
   - Pass arguments with `processor_args`

### Built-in Custom Processors

1. **`truncate`** - Limit content length

   ```yaml
   actions:
     - custom
   custom_processor: "truncate"
   processor_args:
     max_chars: 1000
   ```

2. **`redact_secrets`** - Remove sensitive data

   ```yaml
   actions:
     - custom
   custom_processor: "redact_secrets"
   processor_args:
     patterns:
       - '(?i)api[_-]?key\s*[:=]\s*["\']?[\w-]+["\']?'
   ```

3. **`extract_functions`** - Extract only function definitions (Python)
   ```yaml
   actions:
     - custom
   custom_processor: "extract_functions"
   ```

## Preset Options

### File Matching

- **`extensions`**: List of file extensions (e.g., `[".py", ".js"]`)
- **`patterns`**: Glob patterns for matching files (e.g., `["src/**/*.py"]`)

### Processing Options

- **`actions`**: List of processing actions to apply
- **`strip_tags`**: HTML tags to remove
- **`preserve_tags`**: HTML tags to keep when stripping
- **`separator_style`**: Override default separator ("Standard", "Detailed",
  "Markdown", "None")
- **`include_metadata`**: Whether to include file metadata (default: true)
- **`max_lines`**: Truncate file after N lines

### Custom Processing

- **`custom_processor`**: Name of custom processor
- **`processor_args`**: Arguments for custom processor

## Examples

### WordPress Project

```yaml
wordpress:
  description: "WordPress project processing"

  presets:
    php:
      extensions: [".php"]
      actions:
        - strip_comments
        - remove_empty_lines

    config:
      patterns: ["wp-config*.php", ".env*"]
      actions:
        - custom
      custom_processor: "redact_secrets"

    sql:
      extensions: [".sql"]
      actions:
        - strip_comments
      max_lines: 1000 # Truncate large dumps
```

### Frontend Project

```yaml
frontend:
  description: "React/Vue/Angular project"

  presets:
    components:
      extensions: [".jsx", ".tsx", ".vue"]
      actions:
        - strip_comments
        - compress_whitespace

    styles:
      extensions: [".css", ".scss"]
      actions:
        - minify
      # Note: exclude_patterns is available in global_settings, not in presets

    images:
      extensions: [".png", ".jpg", ".svg"]
      actions:
        - custom
      custom_processor: "truncate"
      processor_args:
        max_chars: 50 # Just filename
```

### Documentation Project

```yaml
documentation:
  description: "Documentation processing"

  presets:
    markdown:
      extensions: [".md", ".mdx"]
      actions:
        - remove_empty_lines
      separator_style: "Markdown"

    code_examples:
      patterns: ["examples/**/*"]
      actions:
        - strip_comments
      max_lines: 50 # Keep examples concise
```

## Priority and Selection

When multiple preset groups are loaded:

1. Groups are checked by priority (highest first)
2. Within a group, presets are checked in order:
   - Extension matches
   - Pattern matches
   - Default preset
3. First matching preset is used
4. If no preset matches, standard m1f processing applies

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# Use single preset file
m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset my-presets.yml

# Use specific group
m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset presets.yml --preset-group backend

# Multiple preset files (merged in order)
m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset base.yml project.yml

# Disable all presets
m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset presets.yml --disable-presets
```

## Complete List of Supported Settings

### Global Settings

These apply to all files unless overridden:

```yaml
global_settings:
  # Encoding and formatting
  encoding: "utf-8"
  separator_style: "Detailed"
  line_ending: "lf"

  # Include/exclude patterns
  include_patterns: ["src/**/*", "lib/**/*"]
  exclude_patterns: ["*.min.js", "*.map"]
  include_extensions: [".py", ".js", ".md"]
  exclude_extensions: [".log", ".tmp"]

  # File filtering
  include_dot_paths: false
  include_binary_files: false
  include_symlinks: false
  no_default_excludes: false
  max_file_size: "10MB"

  # Exclude/include file(s) - can be single file or list
  exclude_paths_file: ".gitignore"
  # Or multiple files:
  # exclude_paths_file:
  #   - ".gitignore"
  #   - ".m1fignore"
  #   - "custom-excludes.txt"

  # Include file(s) for whitelist mode
  # include_paths_file: "important-files.txt"
  # Or multiple files:
  # include_paths_file:
  #   - "core-files.txt"
  #   - "api-files.txt"

  # Processing options
  remove_scraped_metadata: true
  abort_on_encoding_error: false

  # Security
  security_check: "warn" # abort, skip, warn
```

### Extension-Specific Settings

All file-specific settings can now be overridden per extension in
global_settings or in individual presets:

```yaml
global_settings:
  extensions:
    .md:
      actions: [remove_empty_lines]
      security_check: null # Disable security checks for markdown
      remove_scraped_metadata: true
    .php:
      actions: [strip_comments]
      security_check: "abort" # Strict security for PHP
      max_file_size: "5MB"
    .css:
      actions: [minify]
      max_file_size: "50KB" # Stricter size limit for CSS
    .log:
      include_dot_paths: true # Include hidden log files
      max_file_size: "100KB"

presets:
  sensitive_code:
    extensions: [".env", ".key", ".pem"]
    security_check: "abort"
    include_binary_files: false

  documentation:
    extensions: [".md", ".txt", ".rst"]
    security_check: null # No security check for docs
    remove_scraped_metadata: true
```

## Advanced Examples

### Security Check per File Type

Disable security checks for documentation but keep them for code:

```yaml
security_example:
  global_settings:
    security_check: "abort" # Default: strict

    extensions:
      .md:
        security_check: null # Disable for markdown
      .txt:
        security_check: null # Disable for text
      .rst:
        security_check: null # Disable for reStructuredText
      .php:
        security_check: "abort" # Keep strict for PHP
      .js:
        security_check: "warn" # Warn only for JS
      .env:
        security_check: "abort" # Very strict for env files
```

### Size Limits per File Type

Different size limits for different file types:

```yaml
size_limits:
  global_settings:
    max_file_size: "1MB" # Default limit

    extensions:
      .css:
        max_file_size: "50KB" # Stricter for CSS
      .js:
        max_file_size: "100KB" # JavaScript limit
      .php:
        max_file_size: "5MB" # More lenient for PHP
      .sql:
        max_file_size: "10MB" # Large SQL dumps allowed
      .log:
        max_file_size: "500KB" # Log file limit

  presets:
    # Override for specific patterns
    vendor_files:
      patterns: ["vendor/**/*", "node_modules/**/*"]
      max_file_size: "10KB" # Very small for vendor files
```

### Different Processing by Location

Process files differently based on their location:

```yaml
conditional:
  presets:
    # Production files - minify and strip
    production:
      patterns: ["dist/**/*", "build/**/*"]
      actions: [minify, strip_comments]

    # Development files - keep readable
    development:
      patterns: ["src/**/*", "dev/**/*"]
      actions: [remove_empty_lines]

    # Vendor files - skip processing
    vendor:
      patterns: ["vendor/**/*", "node_modules/**/*"]
      actions: [] # No processing
```

### Combining Multiple Presets

You can load multiple preset files that build on each other:

```bash
m1f -s . -o bundle.txt \
  --preset base-rules.yml \
  --preset project-specific.yml \
  --preset production-overrides.yml
```

## Creating Custom Presets

1. **Start with a template**:

   ```bash
   # Use the comprehensive template with all available settings
   cp presets/template-all-settings.m1f-presets.yml my-project.m1f-presets.yml

   # Or start from a simpler example
   cp presets/web-project.m1f-presets.yml my-project.m1f-presets.yml
   ```

2. **Customize for your project**:

   - Identify file types needing special handling
   - Choose appropriate actions
   - Test with a small subset first

3. **Tips**:
   - Use `max_lines` for generated or data files
   - Apply `minify` only to production builds
   - Keep `preserve_tags` for code examples in HTML
   - Use high priority for project-specific rules

## Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Create bundle with presets
  run: |
    m1f \
      -s . \
      -o release-bundle.txt \
      --preset .github/release-presets.yml \
      --preset-group production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Preset not applying

- Check file extension includes the dot (`.py` not `py`)
- Verify pattern matches with `--verbose` flag
- Ensure preset group is enabled

### Wrong preset selected

- Check priority values (higher = checked first)
- Use specific patterns over broad extensions
- Use `--preset-group` to target specific group

### Processing errors

- Some actions may not work on all file types
- Binary files skip most processing
- Use `--verbose` to see which presets are applied

## Auto-Bundling Integration

The preset system integrates seamlessly with the auto-bundling scripts:

### Using Presets with Auto-Bundle

1. **With VS Code Tasks**:

   - Use the "Auto Bundle: With Preset" task
   - Select your preset file and optional group
   - The bundle will apply file-specific processing

2. **With m1f-update Command**:

   ```bash
   # Create all bundles with auto-bundle
   m1f-update

   # Create specific bundle
   m1f-update wordpress

   # List available bundles
   m1f-update --list
   ```

3. **Available Preset Bundles**:
   - `wordpress` - Theme and plugin development
   - `web-project` - Frontend/backend web projects
   - `documentation` - Documentation-focused bundles
   - Custom presets in `presets/` directory

### Benefits

- **Intelligent Filtering**: Each preset knows which files to include
- **Optimized Processing**: Apply minification only where beneficial
- **Security Control**: Different security levels for different file types
- **Size Management**: Appropriate size limits per file type

See the [Auto Bundle Guide](20_auto_bundle_guide.md) for more details on the
bundling system.

# Per-File-Type Settings in m1f Presets

The m1f preset system supports fine-grained control over processing settings on
a per-file-type basis. This allows you to apply different rules to different
file types within the same bundle.

## Overview

You can override almost any m1f setting for specific file extensions or
patterns. This is particularly useful for:

- Disabling security checks for documentation while keeping them for code
- Setting different size limits for CSS vs PHP files
- Applying different processing rules based on file type
- Handling sensitive files differently from public files

## Supported Per-File Settings

The following settings can be overridden on a per-file basis:

### Processing Settings

- `actions` - List of processing actions (minify, strip_comments, etc.)
- `strip_tags` - HTML tags to remove
- `preserve_tags` - HTML tags to preserve
- `separator_style` - Override separator style for specific files
- `include_metadata` - Whether to include file metadata
- `max_lines` - Truncate after N lines

### Security & Filtering

- `security_check` - Override security scanning (`"abort"`, `"skip"`, `"warn"`,
  `null`)
- `max_file_size` - File-specific size limit (e.g., `"50KB"`, `"5MB"`)
- `remove_scraped_metadata` - Remove HTML2MD metadata for specific files
- `include_dot_paths` - Include hidden files for this type
- `include_binary_files` - Include binary files for this type

### Custom Processing

- `custom_processor` - Name of custom processor to use
- `processor_args` - Arguments for the custom processor

## Configuration Methods

### Method 1: Global Extension Settings

Define defaults for all files of a specific extension:

```yaml
my_project:
  global_settings:
    # Default settings for all files
    security_check: "abort"
    max_file_size: "1MB"

    # Extension-specific overrides
    extensions:
      .md:
        security_check: null # Disable for markdown
        remove_scraped_metadata: true
        max_file_size: "500KB"

      .php:
        security_check: "abort" # Keep strict for PHP
        max_file_size: "5MB"
        actions: [strip_comments]

      .css:
        max_file_size: "50KB" # Strict limit for CSS
        actions: [minify, strip_comments]

      .env:
        security_check: "abort"
        include_dot_paths: true # Include .env files
        max_file_size: "10KB"
```

### Method 2: Preset-Specific Settings

Define settings for files matching specific patterns:

```yaml
my_project:
  presets:
    documentation:
      extensions: [".md", ".rst", ".txt"]
      patterns: ["docs/**/*", "README*"]
      security_check: null # No security check
      remove_scraped_metadata: true
      max_file_size: "1MB"

    sensitive_files:
      extensions: [".env", ".key", ".pem"]
      patterns: ["config/**/*", "secrets/**/*"]
      security_check: "abort"
      max_file_size: "50KB"
      include_dot_paths: true

    vendor_code:
      patterns: ["vendor/**/*", "node_modules/**/*"]
      security_check: null # Don't check third-party code
      max_file_size: "100KB" # Only include small files
      actions: [] # No processing
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Web Project with Mixed Content

```yaml
web_project:
  global_settings:
    # Defaults
    security_check: "warn"
    max_file_size: "2MB"

    extensions:
      # Documentation - relaxed rules
      .md:
        security_check: null
        remove_scraped_metadata: true
        actions: [remove_empty_lines]

      # Frontend - strict size limits
      .css:
        max_file_size: "50KB"
        security_check: "skip"
        actions: [minify]

      .js:
        max_file_size: "100KB"
        security_check: "warn"
        actions: [strip_comments, compress_whitespace]

      # Backend - larger files, strict security
      .php:
        max_file_size: "5MB"
        security_check: "abort"
        actions: [strip_comments]

      # Data files - very different handling
      .sql:
        max_file_size: "10MB"
        security_check: null
        max_lines: 1000 # Truncate large dumps
```

### Example 2: Documentation Project

```yaml
documentation:
  global_settings:
    # Default: include everything for docs
    security_check: null
    remove_scraped_metadata: true

    extensions:
      # Markdown files
      .md:
        actions: [remove_empty_lines]
        separator_style: "Markdown"

      # Code examples in docs
      .py:
        max_lines: 50 # Keep examples short
        actions: [strip_comments]

      # Config examples
      .json:
        actions: [compress_whitespace]
        max_lines: 30

      # Log file examples
      .log:
        max_file_size: "100KB"
        max_lines: 100
```

### Example 3: Security-Focused Configuration

```yaml
secure_project:
  global_settings:
    # Very strict by default
    security_check: "abort"
    abort_on_encoding_error: true

    extensions:
      # Public documentation - can be relaxed
      .md:
        security_check: null

      # Code files - different levels
      .js:
        security_check: "warn" # Client-side code

      .php:
        security_check: "abort" # Server-side code

      .env:
        security_check: "abort"
        max_file_size: "10KB" # Env files should be small

      # Config files - careful handling
      .json:
        security_check: "warn"
        actions: [custom]
        custom_processor: "redact_secrets"
```

## Priority and Precedence

When multiple settings could apply to a file, they are resolved in this order:

1. **File-specific preset settings** (highest priority)
   - Settings in a preset that matches the file
2. **Global extension settings**
   - Settings in `global_settings.extensions`
3. **Global defaults** (lowest priority)
   - Settings in `global_settings`

Example:

```yaml
my_project:
  global_settings:
    max_file_size: "1MB" # Default for all

    extensions:
      .js:
        max_file_size: "500KB" # Override for JS files

  presets:
    vendor_js:
      patterns: ["vendor/**/*.js"]
      max_file_size: "2MB" # Override for vendor JS (highest priority)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with sensible defaults** in `global_settings`
2. **Use extension settings** for broad file-type rules
3. **Use presets** for location or context-specific overrides
4. **Document your choices** with comments
5. **Test incrementally** with `--verbose` to see which rules apply

## Limitations

- Settings cascade down but don't merge collections (e.g., `actions` lists
  replace, not extend)
- Some settings only make sense for certain file types
- Binary file detection happens before preset processing

# m1f Preset System Complete Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the m1f preset system,
including all available settings, clarifications, and advanced usage patterns.

- [Important Clarifications](#important-clarifications)
- [Advanced Features](#advanced-features)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Debugging and Best Practices](#debugging-and-best-practices)

## Quick Start

The m1f preset system allows you to define file-specific processing rules and
configurations. Here's a minimal example:

```yaml
# my-preset.yml
web_assets:
  description: "Process web assets"
  presets:
    javascript:
      extensions: [".js", ".jsx"]
      actions: ["minify", "strip_comments"]
```

Use it with:

```bash
# Module invocation (recommended)
m1f -s ./src -o bundle.txt --preset my-preset.yml

# Direct command invocation (if installed)
m1f -s ./src -o bundle.txt --preset my-preset.yml
```

## Preset File Format

### Modern Format (Recommended)

```yaml
# Group name - can be selected with --preset-group
group_name:
  description: "Optional description of this preset group"
  enabled: true # Can disable entire group
  priority: 10 # Higher numbers are processed first (default: 0)
  base_path: "src" # Optional base path for all patterns in this group

  presets:
    # Preset name (for internal reference)
    preset_name:
      patterns: ["*.js", "*.jsx"] # Glob patterns
      extensions: [".js", ".jsx"] # Extension matching (with or without dot)
      actions:
        - minify
        - strip_comments
        - compress_whitespace

      # Per-file overrides
      security_check: "warn" # error, skip, warn
      max_file_size: "500KB"
      include_dot_paths: true
      include_binary_files: false
      remove_scraped_metadata: true

      # Custom processor with arguments
      custom_processor: "truncate"
      processor_args:
        max_lines: 100
        add_marker: true

# Global settings (apply to all groups)

    # Default file processing
    security_check: "warn"
    max_file_size: "1MB"

    # Per-extension settings
    extensions:
      .py:
        security_check: "error"
        max_file_size: "2MB"
      .env:
        security_check: "skip"
        actions: ["redact_secrets"]
```

## Available Actions

### Built-in Actions

1. **`minify`** - Remove unnecessary whitespace and formatting

   - Reduces file size
   - Maintains functionality
   - Best for: JS, CSS, HTML

2. **`strip_tags`** - Remove HTML/XML tags

   - Extracts text content only
   - Preserves text between tags
   - Best for: HTML, XML, Markdown with HTML

3. **`strip_comments`** - Remove code comments

   - Removes single and multi-line comments
   - Language-aware (JS, Python, CSS, etc.)
   - Best for: Production code bundles

4. **`compress_whitespace`** - Reduce multiple spaces/newlines

   - Converts multiple spaces to single space
   - Reduces multiple newlines to double newline
   - Best for: Documentation, logs

5. **`remove_empty_lines`** - Remove blank lines
   - Removes lines with only whitespace
   - Keeps single blank lines between sections
   - Best for: Clean documentation

### Custom Processors

Currently implemented:

1. **`truncate`** - Limit file length

   ```yaml
   custom_processor: "truncate"
   processor_args:
     max_lines: 100
     max_chars: 10000
     add_marker: true # Add "... truncated ..." marker
   ```

2. **`redact_secrets`** - Remove sensitive data

   ```yaml
   custom_processor: "redact_secrets"
   processor_args:
     patterns:
       - '(?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)\\s*[:=]\\s*["\\']?[\\w-]+["\\']?'
       - '(?i)bearer\\s+[\\w-]+'
     replacement: "[REDACTED]"
   ```

3. **`extract_functions`** - Extract function definitions
   ```yaml
   custom_processor: "extract_functions"
   processor_args:
     languages: ["python", "javascript"]
     include_docstrings: true
   ```

Note: Other processors mentioned in examples (like `extract_code_cells`) are
illustrative and would need to be implemented.

## Pattern Matching

### Pattern Types

1. **Extension Matching**

   ```yaml
   extensions: [".py", ".pyx", "py"] # All are equivalent
   ```

2. **Glob Patterns**

   ```yaml
   patterns:
     - "*.test.js" # All test files
     - "src/**/*.js" # All JS in src/
   ```

3. **Combined Matching**
   ```yaml
   # File must match BOTH extension AND pattern
   extensions: [".js"]
   patterns: ["src/**/*"]
   ```

### Base Path Behavior

```yaml
group_name:
  base_path: "src"
  presets:
    example:
      patterns: ["components/*.js"] # Actually matches: src/components/*.js
```

## Processing Order

1. **Group Priority** - Higher priority groups are checked first
2. **Preset Order** - Within a group, presets are checked in definition order
3. **First Match Wins** - First matching preset is applied
4. **Action Order** - Actions are applied in the order listed

### Setting Precedence

1. CLI arguments (highest priority)
2. Preset-specific settings
3. Global per-extension settings
4. Global default settings
5. m1f defaults (lowest priority)

**Note**: CLI arguments ALWAYS override preset values.

## Important Clarifications

### Pattern Matching Limitations

**Exclude patterns with `!` prefix are not supported in preset patterns**. To
exclude files:

1. **Use Global Settings** (Recommended):

   ```yaml
   globals:
     global_settings:
       exclude_patterns: ["*.min.js", "*.map", "dist/**/*"]
   ```

2. **Use CLI Arguments**:
   ```bash
   m1f -s . -o out.txt --exclude-patterns "*.min.js" "*.map"
   ```

### Settings Hierarchy

Understanding where settings can be applied:

1. **Global Settings Level** (`globals.global_settings`):

   - `include_patterns` / `exclude_patterns`
   - `include_extensions` / `exclude_extensions`
   - All general m1f settings

2. **Preset Level** (individual presets):

   - `patterns` and `extensions` (for matching)
   - `actions` (processing actions)
   - Override settings like `security_check`

3. **Extension-Specific Global Settings**
   (`globals.global_settings.extensions.{ext}`):
   - All preset-level settings per extension

### Common Misconceptions

1. **Exclude Patterns in Presets**

   ❌ **Incorrect**:

   ```yaml
   presets:
     my_preset:
       exclude_patterns: ["*.min.js"] # Doesn't work here
   ```

   ✅ **Correct**:

   ```yaml
   globals:
     global_settings:
       exclude_patterns: ["*.min.js"] # Works here
   ```

2. **Actions vs Settings**

   **Actions** (go in `actions` list):

   - `minify`, `strip_tags`, `strip_comments`, etc.

   **Settings** (separate fields):

   - `strip_tags: ["script", "style"]` (configuration)
   - `max_lines: 100` (configuration)

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Presets

```yaml
production:
  enabled_if_exists: ".env.production" # Only active in production
  presets:
    minify_all:
      extensions: [".js", ".css", ".html"]
      actions: ["minify", "strip_comments"]
```

### Multiple Preset Files

```bash
# Files are merged in order (later files override earlier ones)
m1f -s . -o out.txt \
  --preset base.yml \
  --preset project.yml \
  --preset overrides.yml
```

### Preset Locations

1. **Project presets**: `./presets/*.m1f-presets.yml`
2. **Local preset**: `./.m1f-presets.yml`
3. **User presets**: `~/m1f/*.m1f-presets.yml`
4. **Specified presets**: Via `--preset` flag

### Complete Parameter Control (v3.2.0+)

Starting with v3.2.0, ALL m1f parameters can be controlled via presets:

```yaml
# production.m1f-presets.yml
production:
  description: "Production build configuration"

  global_settings:
    # Define all inputs/outputs
    source_directory: "./src"
    output_file: "dist/bundle.txt"
    input_include_files: ["README.md", "LICENSE"]

    # Enable production features
    add_timestamp: true
    create_archive: true
    archive_type: "tar.gz"
    force: true

    # Production optimizations
    minimal_output: true
    quiet: true

    # File processing
    separator_style: "MachineReadable"
    encoding: "utf-8"
    security_check: "error"
```

Usage comparison:

**Before v3.2.0** (long command):

```bash
m1f -s ./src -o dist/bundle.txt \
  --input-include-files README.md LICENSE \
  --add-timestamp --create-archive --archive-type tar.gz \
  --force --minimal-output --quiet \
  --separator-style MachineReadable \
  --security-check error
```

**After v3.2.0** (simple command):

```bash
m1f --preset production.m1f-presets.yml -o output.txt
```

## Examples

### Web Development Preset

```yaml
web_development:
  description: "Modern web development bundle"

  presets:
    # Minify production assets
    production_assets:
      patterns: ["dist/**/*", "build/**/*"]
      extensions: [".js", ".css"]
      actions: ["minify", "strip_comments"]

    # Source code - keep readable
    source_code:
      patterns: ["src/**/*"]
      extensions: [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]
      actions: ["strip_comments"]
      security_check: "error"

    # Documentation
    docs:
      extensions: [".md", ".mdx"]
      actions: ["compress_whitespace", "remove_empty_lines"]

    # Configuration files
    config:
      patterns: ["*.json", "*.yml", "*.yaml"]
      security_check: "error"
      custom_processor: "redact_secrets"
```

### Data Science Preset

```yaml
data_science:
  presets:
    # Large data files - truncate
    data_files:
      extensions: [".csv", ".json", ".parquet"]
      max_file_size: "100KB"
      custom_processor: "truncate"
      processor_args:
        max_lines: 1000

    # Scripts - full content
    scripts:
      extensions: [".py", ".r", ".jl"]
      actions: ["strip_comments"]
```

### Multiple Environment Presets

```yaml
# environments.m1f-presets.yml
development:
  priority: 10
  global_settings:
    source_directory: "./src"
    output_file: "dev-bundle.txt"
    verbose: true
    include_dot_paths: true
    security_check: "warn"

staging:
  priority: 20
  global_settings:
    source_directory: "./src"
    output_file: "stage-bundle.txt"
    create_archive: true
    security_check: "error"

production:
  priority: 30
  global_settings:
    source_directory: "./dist"
    output_file: "prod-bundle.txt"
    minimal_output: true
    quiet: true
    create_archive: true
    archive_type: "tar.gz"
```

Use with `--preset-group`:

```bash
# Development build
m1f --preset environments.yml --preset-group development

# Production build
m1f --preset environments.yml --preset-group production
```

## Debugging and Best Practices

### Debugging Tips

1. **Verbose Mode**

   ```bash
   m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset my.yml --verbose
   ```

   Shows which preset is applied to each file and processing details.

2. **Check What's Applied**

   ```bash
   m1f -s . -o out.txt --preset my.yml --verbose 2>&1 | grep "Applying preset"
   ```

3. **Validate YAML**

   ```bash
   python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('my-preset.yml'))"
   ```

4. **Test Small First** Create a test directory with a few files to verify
   preset behavior before running on large codebases.

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with basic actions, add complexity as needed
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Use verbose mode to verify behavior
3. **Layer Presets** - Use multiple files for base + overrides
4. **Document Presets** - Add descriptions to groups and complex presets
5. **Version Control** - Keep presets in your repository
6. **Performance First** - Apply expensive actions only where needed
7. **Use Priority Wisely** - Higher priority groups are checked first

### Common Issues

1. **Preset not applied**

   - Check pattern matching
   - Verify preset group is enabled
   - Use verbose mode to debug

2. **Wrong action order**

   - Actions are applied sequentially
   - Order matters (e.g., minify before strip_comments)

3. **Performance issues**
   - Limit expensive actions to necessary files
   - Use `max_file_size` to skip large files
   - Consider `minimal_output` mode

## Version Information

This documentation is accurate as of m1f version 3.2.0.

======= docs/01_m1f/20_auto_bundle_guide.md ======
# Auto-Bundle Guide

The m1f auto-bundle feature allows you to automatically generate predefined
bundles of files based on configuration. This is especially useful for
maintaining consistent documentation bundles, creating project snapshots, and
managing multiple projects on a server.

## Configuration File

Auto-bundle looks for a `.m1f.config.yml` file in your project. The tool
searches from the current directory upward to the root, allowing flexible
project organization.

### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
# .m1f.config.yml

# Global settings that apply to all bundles
global:
  global_excludes:
    - "**/*.pyc"
    - "**/*.log"
    - "**/tmp/**"

# Bundle definitions
bundles:
  docs:
    description: "Project documentation"
    output: "m1f/docs/manual.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "docs"
        include_extensions: [".md", ".txt"]

  code:
    description: "Source code bundle"
    output: "m1f/src/code.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "src"
        include_extensions: [".py", ".js", ".ts"]
```

## Command Usage

### Create All Bundles

```bash
m1f auto-bundle
# Or use the convenient alias:
m1f-update
```

### Create Specific Bundle

```bash
m1f auto-bundle docs
# Or use the convenient alias:
m1f-update docs
```

### List Available Bundles

```bash
m1f auto-bundle --list
```

### Create Bundles by Group

```bash
m1f auto-bundle --group documentation
# Or use the convenient alias:
m1f-update --group documentation
```

**Note**: The `m1f-update` command is a convenient alias for `m1f auto-bundle`
that provides a simpler way to regenerate bundles.

## Bundle Groups

You can organize bundles into groups for easier management:

```yaml
bundles:
  user-docs:
    description: "User documentation"
    group: "documentation"
    output: "m1f/docs/user.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "docs/user"

  api-docs:
    description: "API documentation"
    group: "documentation"
    output: "m1f/docs/api.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "docs/api"

  frontend-code:
    description: "Frontend source code"
    group: "source"
    output: "m1f/src/frontend.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "frontend"
```

Then create all documentation bundles:

```bash
m1f auto-bundle --group documentation
```

## Server-Wide Usage

### Managing Multiple Projects

For server environments with multiple projects, you can create a management
script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# update-all-bundles.sh

# Find all projects with .m1f.config.yml
for config in $(find /home/projects -name ".m1f.config.yml" -type f); do
    project_dir=$(dirname "$config")
    echo "Updating bundles in: $project_dir"

    cd "$project_dir"
    m1f-update --quiet
done
```

### Project-Specific Bundles

Create project-specific configurations by using groups:

```yaml
# Project A - .m1f.config.yml
bundles:
  all:
    description: "Complete project bundle"
    group: "project-a"
    output: "m1f/project-a-complete.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "."
```

Then update only specific projects:

```bash
cd /path/to/project-a
m1f-update --group project-a
```

### Automated Bundle Updates

Set up a cron job for automatic updates:

```bash
# Update all project bundles daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/update-all-bundles.sh
```

### Centralized Bundle Storage

Configure bundles to output to a central location:

```yaml
bundles:
  project-bundle:
    description: "Project bundle for central storage"
    output: "/var/m1f-bundles/myproject/latest.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "."
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Bundles

Enable bundles only when specific files exist:

```yaml
bundles:
  python-docs:
    description: "Python documentation"
    enabled_if_exists: "setup.py"
    output: "m1f/python-docs.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "."
        include_extensions: [".py"]
```

### Multiple Source Configurations

Combine files from different locations with different settings:

```yaml
bundles:
  complete:
    description: "Complete project documentation"
    output: "m1f/complete.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "docs"
        include_extensions: [".md"]
      - path: "src"
        include_extensions: [".py"]
        excludes: ["**/test_*.py"]
      - path: "."
        include_files: ["README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]

  # New in v3.4.0: Using includes patterns
  tool-specific:
    description: "Specific tool code only"
    output: "m1f/tool-code.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "tools/"
        include_extensions: [".py"]
        includes: ["m1f/**", "s1f/**", "!**/test_*.py"]
```

### Using Presets

Apply presets for advanced file processing:

```yaml
bundles:
  web-bundle:
    description: "Web project bundle"
    output: "m1f/web.txt"
    preset: "presets/web-project.m1f-presets.yml"
    preset_group: "production"
    sources:
      - path: "."
```

## Automatic Bundle Generation with Git Hooks

m1f provides a Git pre-commit hook that automatically runs auto-bundle before
each commit. This ensures your bundles are always in sync with your source code.

### Installing the Git Hook

```bash
# Run from your project root (where .m1f.config.yml is located)
bash /path/to/m1f/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The hook will:

- Run `m1f-update` before each commit
- Add generated bundles to the commit automatically
- Block commits if bundle generation fails

For detailed setup instructions, see the
[Git Hooks Setup Guide](../05_development/56_git_hooks_setup.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Organize with Groups**: Use groups to categorize bundles logically
2. **Version Control**: Include `.m1f.config.yml` in version control
3. **Include m1f/ Directory**: Keep generated bundles in version control for AI
   tool access
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make bundle names self-explanatory
5. **Regular Updates**: Use Git hooks or schedule automatic updates for
   frequently changing projects
6. **Review Bundle Changes**: Check generated bundle diffs before committing

## Troubleshooting

### Config Not Found

If you see "No .m1f.config.yml configuration found!", the tool couldn't find a
config file searching from the current directory up to the root. Create a
`.m1f.config.yml` in your project root.

### Bundle Not Created

Check the verbose output:

```bash
m1f-update --verbose
```

Common issues:

- Incorrect file paths
- Missing source directories
- Invalid YAML syntax
- Disabled bundles

### Group Not Found

If using `--group` and no bundles are found:

1. Check that bundles have the `group` field
2. Verify the group name matches exactly
3. Use `--list` to see available groups

## Examples

### Documentation Site Bundle

```yaml
bundles:
  docs-site:
    description: "Documentation site content"
    group: "documentation"
    output: "m1f/docs-site.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "content"
        include_extensions: [".md", ".mdx"]
      - path: "src/components"
        include_extensions: [".jsx", ".tsx"]
    excludes:
      - "**/node_modules/**"
      - "**/.next/**"
```

### Multi-Language Project

```yaml
bundles:
  python-code:
    description: "Python backend code"
    group: "backend"
    output: "m1f/backend/python.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "backend"
        include_extensions: [".py"]

  javascript-code:
    description: "JavaScript frontend code"
    group: "frontend"
    output: "m1f/frontend/javascript.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "frontend"
        include_extensions: [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]

When you need to combine files from completely different directories:

```yaml
bundles:
  # Combine documentation from multiple locations
  all-docs:
    description: "All project documentation"
    output: "m1f/all-docs.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "docs"
      - path: "src"
        include_extensions: [".md"]
      - path: "../shared-docs"
      - path: "/absolute/path/to/external/docs"
        includes: ["api/**", "guides/**"]
```

### WordPress Plugin Bundle

```yaml
bundles:
  wp-plugin:
    description: "WordPress plugin files"
    group: "wordpress"
    output: "m1f/wp-plugin.txt"
    preset: "presets/wordpress.m1f-presets.yml"
    sources:
      - path: "."
        include_extensions: [".php", ".js", ".css"]
    excludes:
      - "**/vendor/**"
      - "**/node_modules/**"
```

# m1f Development Workflow

This document describes the recommended workflow for developing with m1f and
using it in other projects.

## Overview

The m1f project provides a self-contained development environment with:

- Pre-generated m1f bundles of its own source code
- Shell aliases for convenient access from anywhere
- Symlink system for using m1f documentation in other projects

## Prerequisites

For initial setup instructions, see the [SETUP.md](../../SETUP.md) guide.

## Using m1f in Other Projects

### Method 1: Using Aliases (Recommended)

From any directory, you can use m1f directly:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
m1f -s . -o combined.txt
```

### Method 2: Quick Project Setup with m1f-init

When starting a new project with m1f, use `m1f-init` for quick setup:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
m1f-init
```

#### What m1f-init does:

1. **Links m1f documentation** (creates `m1f/m1f.txt`)

   - Makes m1f docs available to AI tools
   - Creates symlink on Linux/macOS, copies on Windows
   - Use `--no-symlink` to skip this step if not needed

2. **Analyzes your project**

   - Detects project type and programming languages
   - Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Java, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby
   - Creates file and directory listings
   - Shows clean output with created files listed at the end
   - Automatically cleans up temporary analysis files

3. **Generates initial bundles with auxiliary files**

   - `m1f/<project>_complete.txt` - Full project bundle
   - `m1f/<project>_complete_filelist.txt` - List of all included files
   - `m1f/<project>_complete_dirlist.txt` - List of all directories
   - `m1f/<project>_docs.txt` - Documentation only bundle
   - `m1f/<project>_docs_filelist.txt` - List of documentation files
   - `m1f/<project>_docs_dirlist.txt` - Documentation directories

4. **Creates basic configuration**
   - Generates `.m1f.config.yml` if not present
   - Sets up sensible defaults
   - Handles .gitignore correctly (only uses from current directory)
   - Smart Git detection (clean messages for subdirectories)

#### Using with AI Tools:

After running `m1f-init`, reference the documentation in your AI tool:

```bash
# For Claude Code, Cursor, or similar AI assistants:
@m1f/m1f.txt

# Example prompts:
"Please read @m1f/m1f.txt and help me create custom bundles
for my Python web application"

"Based on @m1f/m1f.txt, how can I exclude test files
while keeping fixture data?"

"Using @m1f/m1f.txt as reference, help me optimize
my .m1f.config.yml for a React project"
```

#### Advanced Setup (Linux/macOS only):

For topic-specific bundles and Claude-assisted configuration:

```bash
m1f-claude --advanced-setup
```

#### Working with File Lists:

The generated file lists are valuable for customizing bundles:

```bash
# View what files are included
cat m1f/*_filelist.txt | wc -l  # Count total files

# Edit file lists to customize bundles
vi m1f/myproject_complete_filelist.txt
# Remove lines for files you don't want
# Add paths for files you do want

# Create a custom bundle from edited list
m1f -i m1f/myproject_complete_filelist.txt -o m1f/custom.txt

# Combine multiple file lists
cat m1f/*_docs_filelist.txt m1f/api_filelist.txt | sort -u > m1f/combined_list.txt
m1f -i m1f/combined_list.txt -o m1f/docs_and_api.txt
```

This single documentation file contains:

- Complete m1f usage guide and all parameters
- Examples and best practices
- Preset system documentation
- Auto-bundle configuration guide
- All tool documentation (m1f, s1f, html2md, webscraper)

The AI can then:

- Understand all m1f parameters and options
- Help create custom `.m1f.config.yml` configurations
- Suggest appropriate presets for your project type
- Generate complex m1f commands with correct syntax
- Troubleshoot issues based on error messages

## Development Workflow

### When Developing m1f

1. Always work in the development environment:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/m1f
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Test changes directly:

   ```bash
   python -m tools.m1f -s test_dir -o output.txt
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Update bundle files after significant changes:
   ```bash
   m1f-update
   ```

### When Using m1f in Projects

1. Use the global aliases:

   ```bash
   m1f -s src -o bundle.txt --preset documentation
   ```

2. Or create project-specific configuration:

   ```bash
   # Create .m1f directory in your project
   mkdir .m1f

   # Create m1f preset
   cat > .m1f/project.m1f-presets.yml << 'EOF'
   presets:
     my-bundle:
       source_directory: "."
       include_extensions: [".py", ".md", ".txt"]
       excludes: ["*/node_modules/*", "*/__pycache__/*"]
   EOF

   # Use preset
   m1f --preset .m1f/project.m1f-presets.yml --preset-group my-bundle -o bundle.txt
   ```

## Directory Structure

```

├── .m1f/                      # Pre-generated m1f bundles
│   ├── m1f/                   # Tool bundles

    └── html2md/

your-project/
└── .m1f/
    └── m1f -> /path/to/m1f/.m1f/  # Symlink to m1f bundles
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Bundles Updated**: Run `m1f-update` after significant changes to m1f
2. **Use Aliases**: The shell aliases handle virtual environment activation
   automatically
3. **Project Organization**: Keep project-specific m1f configurations in `.m1f/`
   directory
4. **Version Control**: The `.m1f/` directory is already in `.gitignore`

## Troubleshooting

### Aliases Not Working

If aliases don't work after setup:

1. Make sure you've reloaded your shell configuration
2. Check that the aliases were added to your shell config file
3. Verify the m1f project path is correct in the aliases

### Virtual Environment Issues

The aliases automatically activate the virtual environment. If you encounter
issues:

1. Ensure the virtual environment exists at `/path/to/m1f/.venv`
2. Check that all dependencies are installed

### Symlink Issues

If `m1f-link` fails:

1. Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
2. Check that the m1f project path is accessible
3. Remove any existing `.m1f/m1f` symlink and try again

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Bundle Generation

Create custom bundles for specific use cases:

```bash
# Bundle only specific file types
m1f -s /path/to/project -o api-docs.txt \
    --include-extensions .py .yaml \
    --excludes "*/tests/*" \
    --separator-style Markdown

# Create compressed archive
m1f -s . -o project.txt --create-archive --archive-type tar.gz
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Add m1f to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Generate Documentation Bundle
  run: |
    python -m tools.m1f -s docs -o docs-bundle.txt

- name: Upload Bundle
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: documentation
    path: docs-bundle.txt
```

======= docs/01_m1f/25_m1f_config_examples.md ======
# m1f Configuration Examples

This guide provides comprehensive examples of `.m1f.config.yml` files for
different project types. Each example includes detailed comments explaining the
configuration choices.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: m1f automatically excludes many common directories
> (node_modules, .git, **pycache**, etc.). See the
> [Default Excludes Guide](./26_default_excludes_guide.md) for the complete
> list. **Only add project-specific excludes to keep your configs minimal!**

## üö® IMPORTANT: Use Standard Separator for AI Bundles!

**The primary purpose of m1f bundles is to provide context to AI assistants like
Claude, NOT for human reading in Markdown!**

- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS use**: `separator_style: Standard` (or omit it - Standard is the
  default)
- ‚ùå **AVOID**: `separator_style: Markdown` (this adds unnecessary ```language
  blocks)
- üéØ **Why**: Standard format is clean and optimal for AI consumption

```yaml
# CORRECT - For AI consumption:
bundles:
  - name: my-bundle
    separator_style: Standard  # ‚Üê This is optimal (or just omit it)

# AVOID - Adds unnecessary markdown formatting:
bundles:
  - name: my-bundle
    separator_style: Markdown  # ‚Üê Don't use for AI bundles!
```

**Note**: `MachineReadable` is only needed when you plan to use `s1f` to split
the bundle back into individual files.

## Minimal vs Verbose Configurations

### ‚ùå BAD Example - Overly Verbose (Don't Do This!)

```yaml
global:
  global_excludes:
    # ‚ùå ALL of these are already excluded by default!
    - "**/node_modules/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/vendor/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/__pycache__/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/build/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/dist/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/.git/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/cache/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/.vscode/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/.idea/**" # Auto-excluded

    # ‚úÖ Only these are needed (project-specific)
    - "**/logs/**"
    - "**/tmp/**"
    - "/m1f/**"
```

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example - Minimal Configuration

```yaml
global:
  global_excludes:
    # Only project-specific excludes
    - "**/logs/**" # Your log files
    - "**/tmp/**" # Your temp files
    - "/m1f/**" # Output directory

  global_settings:
    # Let .gitignore handle most excludes
    exclude_paths_file: ".gitignore"
```

## Best Practices

When creating your `.m1f.config.yml`:

1. **Group Related Files**: Create focused bundles that group related
   functionality
2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive bundle names that indicate
   content
3. **Set Size Limits**: Keep bundles under 100KB for optimal AI performance
4. **Security First**: Always configure proper security checks for sensitive
   files
5. **Leverage Presets**: Use built-in presets for common project types
6. **Exclude Wisely**: Don't bundle generated files, dependencies, or build
   artifacts
7. **Document Purpose**: Add descriptions to help others understand each bundle
8. **Test Configuration**: Run `m1f-update` and check bundle sizes with
   `m1f-token-counter`

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Separate by Layer

```yaml
bundles:
  frontend: # UI components
  backend: # Server logic
  database: # Models and migrations
  api: # API endpoints
  tests: # Test suites
```

### Pattern 2: Separate by Feature

```yaml
bundles:
  feature-auth: # Authentication
  feature-payment: # Payment processing
  feature-search: # Search functionality
  feature-admin: # Admin panel
```

### Pattern 3: Separate by Purpose

```yaml
bundles:
  quick-reference: # Essential files for context
  documentation: # All docs
  source-code: # Implementation
  configuration: # Config files
  deployment: # Deploy scripts
```

### Pattern 4: Progressive Detail

```yaml
bundles:
  overview: # High-level summary (10KB)
  core-logic: # Main functionality (50KB)
  full-source: # Complete code (100KB)
  everything: # All files (500KB)
```

Remember: The best configuration depends on your specific project needs and how
you plan to use the bundles with AI assistants.

======= docs/01_m1f/26_default_excludes_guide.md ======
# m1f Default Excludes Guide

This guide explains the files and directories that m1f excludes by default,
helping you write minimal and efficient `.m1f.config.yml` configurations.

## üö® CRITICAL: Correct Bundle Format

**ALWAYS use the `sources:` array format, NOT `source_directory:`!**

```yaml
# ‚úÖ CORRECT FORMAT:
bundles:
  - name: my-bundle
    sources:
      - "./src"
    output_file: "m1f/my-bundle.txt"
    separator_style: Standard  # Or omit - Standard is default

# ‚ùå WRONG FORMAT (will cause errors):
bundles:
  my-bundle:
    source_directory: "./src"  # This format causes "ERROR: At least one of -s/--source-directory..."
    output_file: "m1f/my-bundle.txt"
    separator_style: Detailed  # Don't use for AI bundles!
```

**ALWAYS test with `m1f-update` immediately after creating/editing
.m1f.config.yml!**

## Understanding Default Excludes

**IMPORTANT**: m1f automatically excludes many common directories and files. You
DON'T need to repeat these in your configuration - only add project-specific
exclusions!

## Default Excluded Directories

The following directories are ALWAYS excluded unless you explicitly use
`--no-default-excludes`:

```yaml
# These are excluded automatically - no need to add them to your config!
- vendor/ # Composer dependencies (PHP)
- node_modules/ # NPM dependencies (JavaScript)
- build/ # Common build output directory
- dist/ # Distribution/compiled files
- cache/ # Cache directories
- .git/ # Git repository data
- .svn/ # Subversion data
- .hg/ # Mercurial data
- __pycache__/ # Python bytecode cache
- .pytest_cache/ # Pytest cache
- .mypy_cache/ # MyPy type checker cache
- .tox/ # Tox testing cache
- .coverage/ # Coverage.py data
- .eggs/ # Python eggs
- htmlcov/ # HTML coverage reports
- .idea/ # IntelliJ IDEA settings
- .vscode/ # Visual Studio Code settings
```

## Default Excluded Files

These specific files are also excluded automatically:

```yaml
# These files are excluded by default:
- LICENSE # License files (usually not needed in bundles)
- package-lock.json # NPM lock file
- composer.lock # Composer lock file
- poetry.lock # Poetry lock file
- Pipfile.lock # Pipenv lock file
- yarn.lock # Yarn lock file
```

## Writing Minimal Configurations

### ‚ùå BAD - Overly Verbose Configuration

```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS - repeating default excludes unnecessarily!
global:
  global_excludes:
    - "**/node_modules/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/vendor/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/__pycache__/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/build/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/dist/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/.git/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/cache/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/.vscode/**" # Already excluded by default!
    - "**/*.pyc" # Project-specific - OK
    - "**/logs/**" # Project-specific - OK
```

### ‚úÖ GOOD - Minimal Configuration

```yaml
# Only add project-specific exclusions!
global:
  global_excludes:
    - "**/*.pyc" # Python bytecode
    - "**/logs/**" # Your project's log files
    - "**/tmp/**" # Your temporary directories
    - "/m1f/**" # Output directory
    - "**/secrets/**" # Sensitive data
```

## Common Patterns by Project Type

### Python Projects

```yaml
# Only add what's NOT in default excludes
global:
  global_excludes:
    - "**/*.pyc" # Bytecode files
    - "**/*.pyo" # Optimized bytecode
    - "**/*.pyd" # Python DLL files
    - "**/venv/**" # Virtual environments
    - "**/.venv/**" # Alternative venv naming
    - "**/env/**" # Another venv naming
```

### Node.js Projects

```yaml
# node_modules is already excluded!
global:
  global_excludes:
    - "**/.next/**" # Next.js build cache
    - "**/.nuxt/**" # Nuxt.js build cache
    - "**/coverage/**" # Test coverage reports
    - "**/*.log" # Log files
```

### WordPress Projects

```yaml
# Only WordPress-specific excludes needed
global:
  global_excludes:
    - "**/wp-content/uploads/**" # User uploads
    - "**/wp-content/cache/**" # Cache plugins
    - "**/wp-content/backup/**" # Backup files
    - "wp-admin/**" # Core files
    - "wp-includes/**" # Core files
```

## Using .gitignore as Exclude File

Instead of manually listing excludes, use your existing .gitignore:

```yaml
global:
  global_settings:
    # This automatically uses your .gitignore patterns!
    exclude_paths_file: ".gitignore"
```

Or use multiple exclude files:

```yaml
global:
  global_settings:
    exclude_paths_file:
      - ".gitignore" # Version control ignores
      - ".m1fignore" # m1f-specific ignores
```

## Checking What's Excluded

To see all excluded paths (including defaults), use verbose mode:

```bash
m1f -s . -o test.txt --verbose
```

This will show:

- Default excluded directories
- Patterns from your config
- Files matched by your exclude patterns

## Disabling Default Excludes

If you need to include normally excluded directories:

```bash
# Include everything, even node_modules, .git, etc.
m1f -s . -o complete.txt --no-default-excludes
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This can create HUGE bundles and include sensitive data!

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with no excludes and add only as needed
2. **Use .gitignore**: Leverage existing ignore patterns
3. **Test First**: Run with `--verbose` to see what's excluded
4. **Document Why**: Add comments explaining non-obvious excludes

```yaml
global:
  global_excludes:
    # Project-specific build artifacts
    - "**/generated/**" # Auto-generated code
    - "**/reports/**" # Test/coverage reports

    # Large data files
    - "**/*.sqlite" # Database files
    - "**/*.csv" # Data exports

    # Sensitive information
    - "**/.env*" # Environment files
    - "**/secrets/**" # API keys, certs
```

## Quick Reference

### Already Excluded (Don't Repeat)

- `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `build/`, `dist/`
- `.git/`, `.svn/`, `.hg/`
- `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`
- `.idea/`, `.vscode/`
- Lock files: `*.lock`, `package-lock.json`

### Commonly Added (Project-Specific)

- Virtual envs: `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`
- Logs: `*.log`, `logs/`
- Temp files: `tmp/`, `temp/`, `*.tmp`
- Database: `*.sqlite`, `*.db`
- Environment: `.env`, `.env.*`
- Output: `/m1f/` (your bundle directory)

## Summary

Keep your `.m1f.config.yml` files clean and minimal by:

1. NOT repeating default excludes
2. Only adding project-specific patterns
3. Using `.gitignore` when possible
4. Documenting non-obvious exclusions

This makes your configurations easier to read, maintain, and share with others!

# Claude + m1f: Your AI-Powered Project Assistant 🤖

Ever wished you had an AI buddy who actually understands your project structure?
That's what happens when you combine Claude with m1f. This guide shows you how
to turn Claude into your personal project assistant who knows exactly how to
bundle, organize, and process your code.

## The Power of m1f v3.2 + Claude ✨

With m1f v3.2's enhanced features, Claude can help you:

- Configure comprehensive security scanning
- Set up parallel processing for faster bundling
- Create sophisticated preset configurations
- Manage content deduplication strategies
- Handle complex encoding scenarios

## Getting Started with Claude

### Step 1: Give Claude the Power

First, let's get Claude up to speed on what m1f can do:

```bash
cd /your/awesome/project
m1f-init  # Quick setup: links docs, analyzes project, creates bundles
```

Boom! 💥 This command:

- Creates m1f/m1f.txt symlink to the complete documentation
- Analyzes your project structure
- Generates initial bundles (complete and docs)
- Creates a basic .m1f.config.yml

For advanced setup with topic-specific bundles (Linux/macOS only):

```bash
m1f-claude --advanced-setup
```

### Step 2: Start the Conversation

Here's where it gets fun. Just tell Claude what you need:

```
Hey Claude, I need help setting up m1f for my project.
Check out @m1f/m1f.txt to see what m1f can do.

My project is a Python web app with:
- Backend API in /api
- Frontend React code in /frontend
- Tests scattered around
- Some docs in /docs

Can you create a .m1f.config.yml that bundles these intelligently?
```

Claude will read the docs and create a perfect config for your project
structure. No more guessing at parameters!

## Real-World Workflows That Actually Work 🚀

### The "Security-First Bundle" Workflow

```
Claude, I need to create bundles for external review.
Using m1f v3.2's security features:

1. Create a config that scans for secrets (security_check: error)
2. Exclude any files with sensitive data
3. Set up proper path validation
4. Ensure no internal IPs or credentials leak through

Focus on making it safe to share with contractors.
```

### The "Performance Optimization" Workflow

```
Claude, my project has 5000+ files and bundling is slow.
Help me optimize using m1f v3.2's features:

1. Leverage parallel processing (enabled by default)
2. Set up smart file size limits
3. Use content deduplication to reduce bundle size
4. Create targeted bundles instead of one massive file

The goal is sub-10 second bundle generation.
```

### The "Multi-Environment Setup" Workflow

```
Claude, I need different bundles for dev/staging/prod.
Using m1f v3.2's preset system:

1. Create environment-specific presets
2. Use conditional presets (enabled_if_exists)
3. Set different security levels per environment
4. Configure appropriate output formats

Make it so I can just run: m1f --preset env.yml --preset-group production
```

## Using m1f-claude: Advanced Project Setup 🧠

For advanced project-specific configuration, use m1f-claude (Linux/macOS only):

```bash
# First, run the quick setup
m1f-init

# Then for advanced configuration with Claude's help
m1f-claude --advanced-setup
```

### What Makes m1f-claude Special?

When you use `m1f-claude --advanced-setup`, it:

- Analyzes your project in detail with Claude's assistance
- Creates topic-specific bundles (components, API, tests, etc.)
- Optimizes configuration for your specific project type
- Provides intelligent suggestions based on your codebase

**Note**: m1f-claude requires Claude Code SDK and is not available on Windows.
Windows users can manually customize their .m1f.config.yml after running
m1f-init.

### 💡 Important: Claude Code Subscription Recommended

**We strongly recommend using Claude Code with a subscription plan** when using
m1f-claude for project setup. Setting up m1f with Claude's assistance can
involve:

- Multiple file reads to analyze your project structure
- Creating and editing configuration files
- Running various commands to test configurations
- Iterative refinement of bundles

Since we don't know exactly how many tokens this process will consume, a
subscription ensures you won't run into usage limits during critical setup
phases. The investment pays off quickly through the time saved in properly
configuring your project.

## Working with Claude Code

If you're using Claude Code (claude.ai/code), you can leverage its file reading
capabilities:

```
# In Claude Code, you can directly reference files
Claude, please read my current .m1f.config.yml and suggest improvements
based on m1f v3.2 features like:
- Better security scanning
- Optimized performance settings
- Advanced preset configurations
```

## Advanced v3.2 Patterns 🎯

### The "Complete Configuration via Presets"

With v3.2, you can control everything through presets:

```yaml
# production.m1f-presets.yml
production:
  description: "Production-ready bundles with full security"

  global_settings:
    # Input/Output
    source_directory: "./src"
    output_file: "dist/prod-bundle.txt"
    input_include_files: ["README.md", "LICENSE"]

    # Security (v3.2)
    security_check: "error" # Stop on any secrets

    # Performance (v3.2)
    enable_content_deduplication: true
    prefer_utf8_for_text_files: true

    # Output control
    add_timestamp: true
    create_archive: true
    archive_type: "tar.gz"
    force: true
    minimal_output: true
    quiet: true

    # Processing
    separator_style: "MachineReadable"
    encoding: "utf-8"
    max_file_size: "1MB"

    # Exclusions
    exclude_patterns:
      - "**/*.test.js"
      - "**/*.spec.ts"
      - "**/node_modules/**"
      - "**/.env*"

  presets:
    minify_production:
      patterns: ["dist/**/*"]
      extensions: [".js", ".css"]
      actions: ["minify", "strip_comments"]
```

### The "AI Context Optimization" Pattern

```yaml
bundles:
  ai-context:
    description: "Optimized for Claude and other LLMs"
    output: "m1f/ai-context.txt"
    sources:
      - path: "src"
        include_extensions: [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".jsx", ".tsx"]
        exclude_patterns:
          - "**/*.test.*"
          - "**/*.spec.*"
          - "**/test/**"

    # v3.2 optimizations
    global_settings:
      # Security first
      security_check: "warn"

      # Performance
      enable_content_deduplication: true # Reduce token usage

      # AI-friendly format
      separator_style: "Markdown"
      max_file_size: "100KB" # Keep context focused

      # Clean output
      remove_scraped_metadata: true
      allow_duplicate_files: false
```

### The "Encoding-Aware Bundle" Pattern

```yaml
bundles:
  legacy-code:
    description: "Handle mixed encoding legacy code"
    output: "m1f/legacy-bundle.txt"

    global_settings:
      # v3.2 encoding features
      prefer_utf8_for_text_files: false # Respect original encoding
      convert_to_charset: "utf-8" # But convert output
      abort_on_encoding_error: false # Continue on errors

      # Include everything
      include_binary_files: false
      include_dot_paths: true
```

## Pro Tips for Claude Interactions 💪

### 1. Let Claude Learn Your Project

First time? Let Claude explore:

```
Claude, analyze my project structure and suggest
how to organize it with m1f bundles. Consider:
- What files change together
- Logical groupings for different use cases
- Size limits for AI context windows

Use @m1f/m1f.txt to understand all available options.
```

### 2. Provide Clear Context

```
Claude, here's my project structure from m1f:
- Total files: 500
- Main languages: Python (60%), JavaScript (30%), Docs (10%)
- Special requirements: HIPAA compliance, no credential exposure
- Target use: Sharing with external auditors

Create a secure bundling strategy using m1f v3.2's security features.
Check @m1f/m1f.txt for security parameters.
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

```
Claude, the bundle is too large (50MB). Help me:
1. Use content deduplication more aggressively
2. Set up file size limits
3. Create multiple smaller bundles by component
4. Exclude generated files and build artifacts
```

### 4. Preset Composition

```
Claude, I want layered presets:
1. base.yml - Company-wide standards
2. project.yml - Project-specific rules
3. personal.yml - My personal preferences

Show me how to use them together with proper override behavior.
```

## Security-First Workflows 🔒

### Preparing Code for Review

```
Claude, I need to share code with a contractor. Create a config that:
1. Runs strict security scanning (security_check: error)
2. Validates all file paths
3. Excludes .env files and secrets
4. Redacts any hardcoded credentials
5. Creates an audit trail

Use m1f v3.2's security features to make this bulletproof.
```

### Automated Security Checks

```
Claude, write a Git pre-commit hook that:
1. Runs m1f with security scanning
2. Blocks commits if secrets are found
3. Auto-generates safe bundles
4. Updates the m1f/ directory

Make it work with m1f v3.2's git hooks setup.
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies 🚀

### Large Codebase Handling

```
Claude, optimize m1f for our monorepo (10K+ files):

1. Set up smart exclusion patterns
2. Use size-based filtering
3. Create focused bundles per team
4. Leverage parallel processing
5. Implement caching strategies

Goal: Bundle generation under 30 seconds.
```

### Memory-Efficient Processing

```yaml
# Claude might suggest this for large files
large_files:
  description: "Handle massive log files"

  global_settings:
    max_file_size: "10MB" # Skip huge files
    enable_content_deduplication: true

  presets:
    truncate_logs:
      extensions: [".log", ".txt"]
      custom_processor: "truncate"
      processor_args:
        max_lines: 1000
        add_marker: true
```

## Troubleshooting with Claude 🔧

### Common Issues and Solutions

```
Claude, m1f is flagging false positives for secrets. Help me:
1. Configure security_check levels appropriately
2. Create patterns to exclude test fixtures
3. Set up per-file security overrides
4. Document why certain warnings are acceptable
```

### Performance Debugging

```
Claude, bundling takes 5 minutes. Analyze this verbose output
and suggest optimizations:
[paste m1f --verbose output]

Consider:
- File count and sizes
- Duplicate detection overhead
- Encoding detection delays
- Security scanning bottlenecks
```

## Integration Patterns 🔌

### CI/CD Integration

```
Claude, create a GitHub Action that:
1. Triggers on PR creation
2. Generates comparison bundles (before/after)
3. Posts bundle statistics as PR comment
4. Fails if bundle size increases >10%
5. Runs security scanning on changed files

Use m1f v3.2's features for efficiency.
```

### Documentation Automation

```
Claude, automate our documentation workflow:
1. Scrape our docs site weekly
2. Convert HTML to Markdown
3. Bundle by section with m1f
4. Remove outdated metadata
5. Create versioned archives

Leverage m1f's web scraping and processing features.
```

## Quick Reference Commands 🎪

Some powerful one-liners for common tasks:

```bash
# Give Claude m1f superpowers
m1f-link

# Quick m1f setup for your project
m1f-claude "Setup m1f for a typical Python project with tests and docs"

# Interactive Claude session
m1f-claude -i

# Security audit bundle
m1f -s . -o audit.txt --security-check error --minimal-output

# Fast development bundle (no security checks)
m1f -s ./src -o dev.txt --security-check skip

# Documentation bundle with metadata
m1f -s ./docs -o docs.txt --separator-style Detailed

# Clean bundle for AI consumption
m1f -s . -o ai-context.txt --allow-duplicate-files false

# Help me understand this codebase
m1f-claude "Create bundles to help a new developer understand this project"

# Prep for the AI apocalypse
m1f-claude "Optimize my project for AI assistants with proper context windows"
```

## Your Turn! 🎮

Now you're ready to turn Claude into your personal m1f expert. Remember:

1. Always start with `m1f-link` to give Claude the docs
2. Be specific about what you want to achieve
3. Let Claude suggest optimal configurations based on the documentation
4. Iterate and refine based on results
5. Test security settings thoroughly before sharing

The best part? Claude remembers your conversations, so it gets better at
understanding your project over time.

Happy bundling! 🚀

# Claude Code Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate Claude Code as an optional AI assistant for
the m1f tools project.

## Overview

Claude Code can help automate complex workflows by understanding natural
language prompts and executing the appropriate tools with correct parameters.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- An Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com)

### Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Initial Setup

1. Start Claude Code:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. Login with your API key:

   ```
   /login
   ```

3. Configure Claude Code for this project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/m1f
   claude config
   ```

## Project Configuration

Create `.claude/settings.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "model": "claude-opus-4",
  "customInstructions": "You are helping with the m1f tools project. Key tools available: m1f.py (file bundler), s1f.py (file splitter), mf1-html2md (HTML to Markdown converter), wp_export_md.py (WordPress exporter).",
  "permissions": {
    "write": true,
    "execute": true
  }
}
```

## m1f Project Setup

### Quick Setup with m1f-init

The `m1f-init` command provides cross-platform project initialization:

```bash
# Run in your project directory
m1f-init

# With verbose output
m1f-init --verbose
```

#### What m1f-init Does:

1. **Links m1f Documentation**

   - Creates m1f/m1f.txt symlink (or copies on Windows)
   - Makes documentation accessible to AI tools

2. **Project Analysis**

   - Detects git repository boundaries
   - Analyzes project structure and languages
   - Creates file and directory lists in `m1f/` directory

3. **Creates Initial Bundles with Auxiliary Files**

   - `<project>_complete.txt` - Full project bundle
   - `<project>_complete_filelist.txt` - List of all included files
   - `<project>_complete_dirlist.txt` - List of all directories
   - `<project>_docs.txt` - Documentation only bundle
   - `<project>_docs_filelist.txt` - List of documentation files
   - `<project>_docs_dirlist.txt` - Documentation directories

4. **Generates Configuration**
   - Creates basic .m1f.config.yml if not present
   - Respects .gitignore patterns
   - Excludes m1f/ directory automatically

### Advanced Setup with m1f-claude (Linux/macOS only)

For topic-specific bundles and advanced configuration:

```bash
# First run m1f-init
m1f-init

# Then run advanced setup
m1f-claude --advanced-setup
```

#### What --advanced-setup Does:

- Claude analyzes your project structure in detail
- Creates topic-specific bundles (models, views, tests, etc.)
- Customizes configuration for your project type
- Optimizes bundle organization for AI consumption
- Requires Claude Code SDK installation

**Note**: Windows users can achieve similar results by manually editing
.m1f.config.yml after running m1f-init.

### Working with Generated File Lists

The file lists generated by m1f-init are powerful tools for customization:

```bash
# View statistics
wc -l m1f/*_filelist.txt  # Count files in each bundle

# Create a custom bundle by editing file lists
cp m1f/myproject_complete_filelist.txt m1f/api_only_filelist.txt
vi m1f/api_only_filelist.txt  # Keep only API-related files
m1f -i m1f/api_only_filelist.txt -o m1f/api_bundle.txt

# Combine multiple lists
cat m1f/*_docs_filelist.txt m1f/tests_filelist.txt | sort -u > m1f/docs_and_tests.txt
m1f -i m1f/docs_and_tests.txt -o m1f/combined.txt

# Use directory lists to focus on specific areas
grep "src/components" m1f/myproject_complete_dirlist.txt
m1f -s src/components -o m1f/components_only.txt
```

3. **Configuration File**

   - Creates `.m1f.config.yml` with complete and docs bundles
   - Uses `docs_only: true` for documentation bundle
   - No global file size limits
   - Proper meta file exclusions (LICENSE*, CLAUDE.md, *.lock)

4. **Advanced Segmentation (Optional)**
   - If Claude Code is installed and advanced mode selected
   - Analyzes project structure for components, API, styles, etc.
   - Adds topic-specific bundles to existing configuration
   - Uses `--allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,MultiEdit` for file operations

   ```

## Programmatic Usage

### Using Claude Code in Scripts

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
import json

def claude_command(prompt):
    """Execute a Claude Code command and return the result."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['claude', '-p', prompt, '--output-format', 'json'],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)

# Example: Get optimal m1f parameters
response = claude_command(
    "What are the optimal m1f parameters for bundling a Python project with tests?"
)
print(response)
```

### Integration with m1f Tools

Create `tools/claude_orchestrator.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Orchestrate m1f tools using Claude Code."""

import subprocess
import json
from pathlib import Path

class ClaudeOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {
            'm1f': 'tools/m1f.py',
            's1f': 'tools/s1f.py',
            'mf1-html2md': 'tools/mf1-html2md',
            'wp_export': 'tools/wp_export_md.py'
        }

    def analyze_request(self, user_prompt):
        """Use Claude to analyze user request and determine actions."""
        analysis_prompt = f"""
        Analyze this request and return a JSON with:
        1. tool: which tool to use ({', '.join(self.tools.keys())})
        2. parameters: dict of parameters for the tool
        3. steps: list of steps to execute

        Request: {user_prompt}
        """

        result = subprocess.run(
            ['claude', '-p', analysis_prompt, '--output-format', 'json'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        return json.loads(result.stdout)

    def execute_workflow(self, user_prompt):
        """Execute a complete workflow based on user prompt."""
        plan = self.analyze_request(user_prompt)

        for step in plan['steps']:
            print(f"Executing: {step['description']}")
            # Execute the actual command
            subprocess.run(step['command'], shell=True)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Create project-specific instructions** in `.claude/settings.json`
2. **Use Claude for complex workflows** that require multiple steps
3. **Leverage Claude's understanding** of file patterns and project structure
4. **Combine with shell pipes** for powerful automation

## Example Workflows

### 1. Documentation Processing Pipeline

```bash
# Complete pipeline with Claude
claude -p "Process the scraped documentation in ~/scraped-docs:
1. Analyze HTML structure
2. Create preprocessing config
3. Convert to Markdown preserving structure
4. Create m1f bundles by topic
5. Generate a summary report"
```

### 2. Project Analysis

```bash
# Analyze project for bundling
claude -p "Analyze this Python project and suggest:
1. Which files should be bundled together
2. Optimal m1f parameters
3. Any files that should be excluded"
```

### 3. Automated Testing

```bash
# Run tests and fix issues
claude -p "Run the test suite, identify any failures, and fix them"
```

## Environment Variables

Set these in your shell profile for persistent configuration:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
export CLAUDE_CODE_PROJECT_ROOT="/path/to/m1f"
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission errors**: Ensure Claude Code has write permissions in settings
2. **Model selection**: Use Claude Opus 4 for the most complex analysis, Claude
   Sonnet 4 for balanced performance
3. **Rate limits**: Be mindful of API usage limits

## Security Considerations

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use `.claude/settings.local.json`** for personal settings
3. **Review Claude's actions** before executing in production

# Security Best Practices Guide for m1f Toolkit

## Overview

This guide documents security best practices and protective measures implemented
in the m1f toolkit v3.2. Following these practices ensures safe operation and
prevents common security vulnerabilities.

## Path Validation and Traversal Protection

### Why It Matters

Path traversal attacks can allow malicious actors to access files outside
intended directories, potentially exposing sensitive system files or overwriting
critical data.

### Best Practices

1. **Always validate resolved paths**:

   ```python
   # Good practice - validate after resolving
   from tools.m1f.utils import validate_safe_path

   target_path = Path(user_input).resolve()
   validate_safe_path(target_path, base_path)
   ```

2. **Use the provided validation utilities**:

   - `validate_safe_path()` in `tools/m1f/utils.py` ensures paths stay within
     allowed boundaries
   - All user-provided paths should be validated before use

3. **Symlink safety**:
   - Symlinks are resolved and validated to prevent escaping directories
   - Target of symlinks must be within the allowed base path

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Never use user input directly in file paths without validation
- Don't trust relative paths without resolving and validating them
- Always validate paths from configuration files and presets

## Web Scraping Security

### SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Protection

The toolkit blocks access to:

- Private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x, 192.168.x.x)
- Localhost and loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1)
- Link-local addresses (169.254.x.x)
- Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254)

### SSL/TLS Validation

1. **Default behavior**: SSL certificates are validated by default
2. **Disabling validation** (use with caution):

   ```bash
   # Only for trusted internal sites or testing
   m1f-scrape --ignore-https-errors https://internal-site.com
   ```

   ⚠️ **Warning**: Disabling SSL validation exposes you to man-in-the-middle
   attacks. Only use for trusted internal resources.

### robots.txt Compliance

All scrapers automatically respect robots.txt files:

- Automatically fetched and parsed for each domain
- Scraping is blocked for disallowed paths
- User-agent specific rules are respected
- This is always enabled - no configuration option to disable

### JavaScript Execution Safety

When using Playwright with custom scripts:

- Scripts are validated for dangerous patterns
- Avoid executing untrusted JavaScript code
- Use built-in actions instead of custom scripts when possible

## Command Injection Prevention

### Safe Command Execution

The toolkit uses proper escaping for all system commands:

```python
# Good - using shlex.quote()
import shlex
command = f"httrack {shlex.quote(url)} -O {shlex.quote(output_dir)}"

# Bad - direct string interpolation
command = f"httrack {url} -O {output_dir}"  # DON'T DO THIS
```

## Preset System Security

### File Size Limits

- Preset files are limited to 10MB to prevent memory exhaustion
- Large preset files are rejected with an error

### Path Validation in Presets

- All paths in preset files are validated
- Paths cannot escape the project directory
- Absolute paths outside the project are blocked

### Custom Processor Validation

- Processor names must be alphanumeric with underscores only
- Special characters that could enable code injection are blocked

## Secure Temporary File Handling

The toolkit uses Python's `tempfile` module for all temporary files:

- Temporary directories are created with restricted permissions
- All temporary files are cleaned up after use
- No sensitive data is left in temporary locations

## Security Scanning for Sensitive Data

### Built-in Secret Detection

m1f includes automatic scanning for:

- API keys and tokens
- Passwords and credentials
- Private keys
- High-entropy strings that might be secrets

### Security Check Modes

1. **Error mode** (default): Stops processing if secrets are found

   ```bash
   m1f -s ./src -o output.txt --security-check error
   ```

2. **Warn mode**: Logs warnings but continues processing

   ```bash
   m1f -s ./src -o output.txt --security-check warn
   ```

3. **Skip mode**: Disables security scanning (not recommended)
   ```bash
   m1f -s ./src -o output.txt --security-check skip
   ```

### Handling False Positives

If legitimate content is flagged as sensitive:

1. Review the warnings carefully
2. Use `--security-check warn` if you're certain the content is safe
3. Consider refactoring code to avoid patterns that trigger detection

## Input Validation Best Practices

### File Type Validation

- Use include/exclude patterns to limit processed file types
- Be explicit about allowed file extensions
- Validate file contents match expected formats

### Size and Resource Limits

- Set appropriate limits for file sizes
- Use `--max-file-size` to prevent processing huge files
- Monitor memory usage for large file sets

### Encoding Safety

- The toolkit automatically detects file encodings
- UTF-8 is preferred for text files by default
- Binary files are handled safely without interpretation

## Deployment Security Recommendations

### Environment Configuration

1. Run with minimal required permissions
2. Use dedicated service accounts when possible
3. Avoid running as root/administrator

### Network Security

1. Use HTTPS for all web scraping when possible
2. Configure firewall rules to limit outbound connections
3. Monitor for unusual network activity

### Logging and Monitoring

1. Enable verbose logging for security-sensitive operations
2. Review logs regularly for suspicious patterns
3. Set up alerts for security check failures

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in m1f:

1. Do NOT open a public issue
2. Email security details to the maintainers
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure

## Security Checklist for Users

Before running m1f in production:

- [ ] Validate all input paths and patterns
- [ ] Review security check mode settings
- [ ] Enable SSL validation for web scraping
- [ ] Set appropriate file size limits
- [ ] Use minimal required permissions
- [ ] Review preset files for suspicious content
- [ ] Test security scanning on sample data
- [ ] Configure proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Keep the toolkit updated to the latest version

## Updates and Security Patches

Stay informed about security updates:

- Check the CHANGELOG for security-related fixes
- Update to new versions promptly
- Review breaking changes that might affect security

Remember: Security is a shared responsibility. While m1f implements many
protective measures, proper configuration and usage are essential for
maintaining a secure environment.

# m1f-claude Timeout Improvements

## Problem Statement

The `m1f-claude --advanced-setup` command was experiencing timeout issues ("dauert ewigkeiten" - takes forever) due to:

1. **Blocking subprocess calls** - No progress feedback during execution
2. **No timeout handling** - Could hang indefinitely  
3. **Poor user experience** - Users see nothing while Claude analyzes large projects

## Solution: Apply html2md Improvements

Based on successful improvements in the html2md tool, we've implemented:

### 1. Streaming Output with Timestamps

```python
# OLD: Blocking call with no feedback
result = subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=self.project_path, capture_output=False, text=True)

# NEW: Streaming with progress
runner = M1FClaudeRunner()
returncode, stdout, stderr = runner.run_claude_streaming(
    prompt=prompt,
    timeout=300,  # 5 minutes
    show_output=True
)
```

Users now see:
```
[  0.5s] Reading project structure...
[ 12.3s] Analyzing 1,234 files...
[ 45.6s] Creating bundle configuration...
[123.4s] Writing .m1f.config.yml...
```

### 2. Robust Timeout Handling

- **Absolute timeout**: Default 10 minutes (configurable)
- **Inactivity timeout**: 60 seconds without output
- **Conservative minimums**: `max(60, timeout)` ensures reasonable timeouts
- **Graceful interruption**: Ctrl-C handling with cleanup

### 3. Progress Indicators

During waiting periods:
```
‚è≥ Waiting for Claude... ‚†è [45s]
```

### 4. Better Error Handling

- Clear timeout messages
- Preservation of partial output
- Proper process cleanup
- Informative error reporting

## Implementation Details

### New M1FClaudeRunner Class

Located in `tools/m1f_claude_runner.py`:

- **Binary detection**: Checks PATH and common installation locations
- **Streaming subprocess**: Uses `Popen` for line-by-line output
- **Signal handling**: Graceful interruption support
- **Output collection**: Preserves all output even on timeout

### Integration Points

Modified in `m1f_claude.py`:

1. **advanced_setup() method** (lines 1481-1510)
   - Phase 1: Segmentation with streaming
   - Phase 2: Verification with streaming

2. **Timeout configuration**:
   - 5 minutes for each phase
   - Suitable for large projects
   - Can be increased if needed

## Usage Improvements

### Before (User Experience)
```bash
$ m1f-claude --advanced-setup
ü§ñ Sending to Claude Code...
‚è≥ Claude will now analyze your project...
[Nothing for minutes... appears frozen]
```

### After (User Experience)  
```bash
$ m1f-claude --advanced-setup
ü§ñ Sending to Claude Code...
‚è≥ Claude will now analyze your project...

[  0.5s] Let me analyze your project structure...
[  2.1s] Reading m1f/project_analysis_filelist.txt
[  3.4s] Found 1,234 files across 156 directories
[ 15.6s] Creating topic-specific bundle configuration...
[ 45.2s] Writing updated .m1f.config.yml
[120.3s] ‚úÖ Configuration complete!

‚úÖ Claude completed in 125.4s
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
python test_claude_runner_improvements.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users see what Claude is doing
2. **Reliability**: Automatic timeout prevents infinite hangs  
3. **Debuggability**: Timestamps help identify slow operations
4. **Control**: Can interrupt gracefully with Ctrl-C
5. **Consistency**: Uses same proven approach as html2md

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel processing**: Run multiple Claude tasks concurrently
2. **Resume capability**: Save state for interrupted operations
3. **Progress estimation**: Show percentage completion
4. **Configurable timeouts**: Per-phase timeout settings

## Troubleshooting

### If timeouts still occur:

1. **Increase timeout**: Modify timeout parameter in code
2. **Simplify project**: Use `.m1f.config.yml` excludes
3. **Check Claude installation**: Ensure latest version
4. **Review project size**: Very large projects may need chunking

### Debug mode:

Set `--debug` flag for detailed output:
```bash
m1f-claude --advanced-setup --debug
```

| `--target-encoding`           | Explicitly specify the character encoding to use for all extracted files (e.g., `utf-8`, `latin-1`, `utf-16-le`). This overrides the `--respect-encoding` option and any encoding information in the metadata |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations

```bash
# Basic command (positional arguments)
m1f-s1f /path/to/combined_output.txt /path/to/output_folder

# Basic command (option-style)
m1f-s1f --input-file /path/to/combined_output.txt \
  --destination-directory /path/to/output_folder

# List files in archive without extracting
m1f-s1f --list ./output/bundle.m1f.txt

# Splitting a MachineReadable file with force overwrite and verbose output
m1f-s1f ./output/bundle.m1f.txt ./extracted_project -f -v

# Check version
m1f-s1f --version
```

### Advanced Operations

```bash
# Using current system time for timestamps
m1f-s1f -i ./combined_file.txt -d ./extracted_files \
  --timestamp-mode current

# Preserving original file encodings
m1f-s1f -i ./with_encodings.txt -d ./extracted_files \
  --respect-encoding

# Using a specific encoding for all extracted files
m1f-s1f -i ./combined_file.txt -d ./extracted_files \
  --target-encoding utf-8

# Ignoring checksum verification (when files were intentionally modified)
m1f-s1f -i ./modified_bundle.m1f.txt -d ./extracted_files \
  --ignore-checksum
```

## Supported File Formats

The s1f tool can extract files from combined files created with any of the m1f
separator styles:

- **Standard Style** - Simple separators with file paths and checksums
- **Detailed Style** - Comprehensive separators with full metadata
- **Markdown Style** - Formatted with Markdown syntax for documentation
- **MachineReadable Style** - Structured format with JSON metadata and UUID
  boundaries
- **None Style** - Files combined without separators (limited extraction
  capability)

For the most reliable extraction, use files created with the MachineReadable
separator style, as these contain complete metadata and checksums for
verification.

## Common Workflows

### Extract and Verify

This workflow is useful when you want to ensure the integrity of extracted
files:

```bash
# Step 1: Extract the files with verification
m1f-s1f -i ./project_bundle.m1f.txt -d ./extracted_project -v

# Step 2: Check for any checksum errors in the output
# If any errors are reported, consider using --ignore-checksum if appropriate
```

### Multiple Extraction Targets

When you need to extract the same combined file to different locations:

```bash
# Extract for development
m1f-s1f -i ./project.m1f.txt -d ./dev_workspace

# Extract for backup with original timestamps
m1f-s1f -i ./project.m1f.txt -d ./backup --timestamp-mode original
```

## Performance

S1F v2.0.0 includes significant performance improvements:

- **Async I/O**: Concurrent file writing for 3-5x faster extraction on SSDs
- **Optimized Parsing**: Efficient line-by-line processing with minimal memory
  usage
- **Smart Buffering**: Adaptive buffer sizes based on file characteristics

## Error Handling

The tool provides comprehensive error handling:

- **Checksum Verification**: Automatic integrity checking with clear error
  messages
- **Encoding Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of encoding issues with multiple
  fallback strategies
- **Permission Errors**: Clear reporting of file system permission issues
- **Partial Recovery**: Continue extraction even if individual files fail

  processing
- Recursive directory scanning for batch conversion
- Smart internal link handling (HTML → Markdown)
- Customizable element filtering and removal
- YAML frontmatter generation
- Heading level adjustment
- Code block language detection
- Character encoding detection and conversion
- Parallel processing for faster conversion

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic conversion of all HTML files in a directory
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs

# Use a custom extractor for site-specific conversion
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --extractor ./extractors/custom_extractor.py

# Extract only main content from HTML files
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --content-selector "main.content" --ignore-selectors nav .sidebar footer

# Skip YAML frontmatter and adjust heading levels
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --no-frontmatter --heading-offset 1

# Analyze HTML structure to find best selectors
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/*.html --suggest-selectors

# Analyze with detailed structure output
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/*.html --show-structure --common-patterns

# Use Claude AI to intelligently analyze HTML structure
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/ --claude

# Analyze with Claude and specify number of files to analyze (1-20)
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/ --claude --analyze-files 10

# Convert HTML to Markdown using Claude AI (clean content extraction)
m1f-html2md convert ./html/ -o ./markdown/ --claude --model opus --sleep 2

# Generate a configuration file
m1f-html2md config -o config.yaml
```

### Complete Workflow Example with .scrapes Directory

```bash
# Step 1: Create project structure
mkdir -p .scrapes/my-project/{html,md,extractors}

# Step 2: Download website using webscraper
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o .scrapes/my-project/html

# Step 3: Analyze HTML structure (optional)
m1f-html2md analyze .scrapes/my-project/html/ --suggest-selectors

# Step 4: Create custom extractor (optional)
# Use Claude to analyze and create site-specific extractor:
claude -p "Analyze these HTML files and create a custom extractor for html2md" \
  --files .scrapes/my-project/html/*.html

# Step 5: Convert with custom extractor
m1f-html2md convert .scrapes/my-project/html -o .scrapes/my-project/md \
  --extractor .scrapes/my-project/extractors/custom_extractor.py
```

## Claude AI Integration

html2md offers optional Claude AI integration for intelligent HTML analysis and
conversion:

### Claude Command Detection

The tool automatically detects Claude Code installations in various locations:

- Standard PATH locations
- `~/.claude/local/claude` (common for local installations)
- `/usr/local/bin/claude` and `/usr/bin/claude`

If you have Claude Code installed but get a "command not found" error, the tool
will automatically find and use your Claude binary.

### AI-Powered Analysis

Use Claude to automatically select representative HTML files and suggest optimal
CSS selectors:

```bash
# Analyze a directory of HTML files with Claude
m1f-html2md analyze ./scraped-site/ --claude

# Analyze more files for better coverage (up to 20)
m1f-html2md analyze ./scraped-site/ --claude --analyze-files 10

# Claude will:
# 1. Prompt for project description and important files (if applicable)
# 2. Select representative files from the directory (default: 5)
# 3. Analyze each file's structure individually
# 4. Synthesize findings to suggest optimal selectors
# 5. Generate a YAML configuration (html2md_extract_config.yaml)
```

**Features of Claude Analysis:**

- **Project Context**: Provides project description to help Claude understand
  the content
- **Important File Priority**: Can specify important files for Claude to
  prioritize
- **Multi-phase Analysis**: Individual file analysis followed by synthesis
- **Transparent Process**: Creates temporary analysis files in m1f/ directory
- **Smart Subprocess Handling**: Uses subprocess.run() for reliable Claude CLI
  integration

- **Robust Config Loading**: Handles Claude-generated configs with unknown fields gracefully (v3.4.0)

### AI-Powered Conversion

Use Claude to convert HTML to clean Markdown, extracting only the main content:

```bash
# Convert all HTML files using Claude AI
m1f-html2md convert ./html/ -o ./markdown/ --claude

# Use Opus model for higher quality (default is Sonnet)
m1f-html2md convert ./html/ -o ./markdown/ --claude --model opus

# Add delay between API calls to avoid rate limits
m1f-html2md convert ./html/ -o ./markdown/ --claude --sleep 3
```

The Claude conversion:

- Extracts only the main content (no navigation, ads, etc.)
- Preserves document structure and formatting
- Handles complex HTML layouts intelligently
- Generates clean, readable Markdown

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversion

```bash
# Simple conversion of all HTML files in a directory
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs

# Convert files with verbose logging
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs --verbose

# Convert to m1f bundle format
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs.m1f --format m1f_bundle

# Convert to JSON format for processing
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./data.json --format json
```

### Content Selection

```bash
# Extract only the main content and ignore navigation elements
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --content-selector "main" --ignore-selectors nav .sidebar footer

# Extract article content from specific selectors
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --content-selector "article.content" \
  --ignore-selectors .author-bio .share-buttons .related-articles
```

### HTML Analysis

```bash
# Analyze HTML files to find optimal selectors
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/ --suggest-selectors

# Show detailed structure of HTML files
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/ --show-structure

# Find common patterns across multiple files
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/ --common-patterns

# Get all analysis options
m1f-html2md analyze ./html/ \
  --show-structure --common-patterns --suggest-selectors
```

### File Filtering

```bash
# Process only specific file types
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  -c config.yaml  # Use a configuration file for file filtering
```

### Formatting Options

```bash
# Adjust heading levels (e.g., h1 → h2, h2 → h3)
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --heading-offset 1

# Skip frontmatter generation
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --no-frontmatter

# Use configuration file for advanced formatting options
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs -c config.yaml

# Log conversion process to file
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --log-file conversion.log
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Use parallel processing for faster conversion of large sites
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs \
  --parallel
```

## Custom Extractors

The custom extractor system allows you to create site-specific content
extraction logic for optimal results. Extractors can be simple functions or full
classes.

### Creating a Custom Extractor

#### Function-based Extractor

```python
# extractors/simple_extractor.py
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
    """Extract main content from HTML."""
    # Remove navigation elements
    for nav in soup.find_all(['nav', 'header', 'footer']):
        nav.decompose()

    # Find main content
    main = soup.find('main') or soup.find('article')
    if main:
        new_soup = BeautifulSoup('<html><body></body></html>', 'html.parser')
        new_soup.body.append(main)
        return new_soup

    return soup

def postprocess(markdown: str, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
    """Clean up the converted markdown."""
    # Remove duplicate newlines
    import re
    return re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', markdown)
```

#### Class-based Extractor

```python
# extractors/advanced_extractor.py
from tools.html2md.extractors import BaseExtractor
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

class Extractor(BaseExtractor):
    """Custom extractor for specific website."""

    def extract(self, soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
        """Extract content with site-specific logic."""
        # Custom extraction logic
        return soup

    def preprocess(self, html: str, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
        """Preprocess raw HTML before parsing."""
        # Fix common HTML issues
        return html.replace('&nbsp;', ' ')

    def postprocess(self, markdown: str, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
        """Post-process converted markdown."""
        # Clean up site-specific artifacts
        return markdown
```

### Using Custom Extractors

```bash
# Use with CLI
m1f-html2md convert ./html -o ./markdown \
  --extractor ./extractors/my_extractor.py

# Use with API
from tools.html2md.api import Html2mdConverter
from pathlib import Path

converter = Html2mdConverter(
    config,
    extractor=Path("./extractors/my_extractor.py")
)
```

### .scrapes Directory Structure

The recommended workflow uses a `.scrapes` directory (gitignored) for organizing
scraping projects:

```
.scrapes/
└── project-name/
    ├── html/         # Raw HTML files from scraping
    ├── md/           # Converted Markdown files
    └── extractors/   # Custom extraction scripts
        └── custom_extractor.py
```

This structure keeps scraped content organized and separate from your main
codebase.

## Advanced Features

### YAML Frontmatter

By default, the converter adds YAML frontmatter to each Markdown file,
including:

- Title extracted from HTML title tag or first h1 element
- Source filename
- Conversion date
- Original file modification date

To disable frontmatter generation, use the `--no-frontmatter` option:

```bash
m1f-html2md convert ./website -o ./docs --no-frontmatter
```

The generated frontmatter looks like:

```yaml
---
title: Extracted from HTML
source_file: original.html
date_converted: 2023-06-15T14:30:21
date_modified: 2023-06-12T10:15:33
---
```

### Heading Level Adjustment

The `--heading-offset` option allows you to adjust the hierarchical structure of
the document by incrementing or decrementing heading levels. This is useful
when:

- Integrating content into an existing document with its own heading hierarchy
- Making h1 headings become h2 headings for better document structure
- Ensuring proper nesting of headings for better semantics

Positive values increase heading levels (e.g., h1 → h2), while negative values
decrease them (e.g., h2 → h1).

### Code Block Language Detection

The converter can automatically detect language hints from HTML code blocks that
use language classes, such as:

```html
<pre><code class="language-python">def example():
    return "Hello, world!"
</code></pre>
```

This will be converted to a properly formatted Markdown code block with language
hint:

````markdown
```python
def example():
    return "Hello, world!"
```
````

### Character Encoding Handling

The converter provides robust character encoding detection and conversion:

1. Automatically detects the encoding of source HTML files
2. Properly handles UTF-8, UTF-16, and other encodings
3. All output files are written in UTF-8 encoding
4. Handles BOM (Byte Order Mark) detection for Unicode files

## Architecture

HTML2MD v3.4.0 features a modern, modular architecture:

```
tools/html2md/
├── __init__.py       # Package initialization
├── __main__.py       # Entry point for module execution
├── api.py            # Programmatic API for other tools
├── cli.py            # Command-line interface
├── config/           # Configuration management
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── loader.py     # Config file loader
│   └── models.py     # Config data models
├── core.py           # Core conversion logic
├── extractors.py     # Custom extractor system
├── preprocessors.py  # HTML preprocessing
├── analyze_html.py   # HTML structure analysis
└── utils.py          # Utility functions

.scrapes/             # Project scrapes directory (gitignored)
└── project-name/
    ├── html/         # Raw HTML files
    ├── md/           # Converted Markdown
    └── extractors/   # Custom extractors
```

### Key Components

- **API Mode**: Use as a library in other Python projects
- **Custom Extractors**: Pluggable extractor system for site-specific logic
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and dataclass models
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dependency injection
- **Async Support**: Modern async/await for high performance
- **Workflow Integration**: Organized .scrapes directory structure

## Integration with m1f

The html2md tool works well with the m1f (Make One File) tool for comprehensive
documentation handling:

1. First convert HTML files to Markdown:

   ```bash
   m1f-html2md convert ./html-docs -o ./markdown-docs
   ```

2. Then use m1f to combine the Markdown files:
   ```bash
   m1f -s ./markdown-docs -o ./combined-docs.m1f.txt \
     --separator-style Markdown
   ```

This workflow is ideal for:

- Converting documentation from HTML to Markdown format
- Consolidating documentation from multiple sources
- Preparing content for LLM context windows
- Creating searchable knowledge bases

## Performance Considerations

- For large websites with many HTML files, use the `--parallel` option
- Conversion speed depends on file size, complexity, and number of files
- Memory usage scales with file sizes when parallel processing is enabled
- The tool uses async I/O for efficient file operations

## Programmatic API

Use html2md in your Python projects:

```python
from tools.html2md.api import Html2mdConverter
from tools.html2md.config import Config
from tools.html2md.extractors import BaseExtractor
from pathlib import Path

# Create converter with configuration
config = Config(
    source=Path("./html"),
    destination=Path("./markdown")
)
converter = Html2mdConverter(config)

# Convert with custom extractor
converter = Html2mdConverter(
    config,
    extractor=Path("./extractors/custom_extractor.py")
)

# Or with inline extractor
class MyExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    def extract(self, soup, config=None):
        # Custom logic
        return soup

converter = Html2mdConverter(config, extractor=MyExtractor())

# Convert a single file
output_path = converter.convert_file(Path("page.html"))
print(f"Converted to: {output_path}")

# Convert entire directory
results = converter.convert_directory()
print(f"Converted {len(results)} files")
```

## Requirements and Dependencies

# HTML to Markdown Converter Guide

The `html2md` tool (v3.1.0) is a modern, async converter designed to transform
HTML content into clean Markdown format. Built with Python 3.10+ and modern
async architecture, it focuses on intelligent content extraction and conversion.

**Note:** Web scraping functionality has been moved to the separate `webscraper`
tool. Use `webscraper` to download websites, then `html2md` to convert the
downloaded HTML files.

## Python API

### Basic Usage

```python
from tools.html2md.api import HTML2MDConverter
import asyncio

# Create converter with configuration
converter = HTML2MDConverter(
    outermost_selector="main",
    ignore_selectors=["nav", "footer"],
    add_frontmatter=True
)

# Convert a directory (async)
results = asyncio.run(converter.convert_directory("./html", "./markdown"))

# Convert a single file (async)
result = asyncio.run(converter.convert_file("index.html"))

# Convert with custom extractor
from pathlib import Path

converter = HTML2MDConverter(
    outermost_selector="main",
    extractor=Path("./extractors/custom_extractor.py")
)

result = asyncio.run(converter.convert_file("index.html"))
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from tools.html2md.config.models import HTML2MDConfig

# Create configuration with v3.1.0 models
config = HTML2MDConfig(
    source_dir="./html",
    destination_dir="./output",
    outermost_selector="div.documentation",
    ignore_selectors=[".nav-menu", ".footer"],
    strip_attributes=True,
    heading_offset=1,
    add_frontmatter=True,
    parallel=True,
    max_workers=4
)

converter = HTML2MDConverter.from_config(config)
```

### Convenience Functions

```python
from tools.html2md.api import convert_file, convert_directory
import asyncio

# Simple file conversion (async)
result = asyncio.run(convert_file("page.html", destination="page.md"))

# Directory conversion with options (async)
results = asyncio.run(convert_directory(
    source="./html",
    destination="./markdown",
    outermost_selector="article",
    parallel=True
))
```

## Custom Extractors

The custom extractor system allows you to create site-specific content
extraction logic:

### Function-based Extractor

```python
# extractors/my_extractor.py
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config=None):
    """Extract main content."""
    # Custom extraction logic
    main = soup.find('main')
    if main:
        new_soup = BeautifulSoup('<html><body></body></html>', 'html.parser')
        new_soup.body.append(main)
        return new_soup
    return soup

def postprocess(markdown: str, config=None):
    """Clean up converted markdown."""
    import re
    return re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', markdown)
```

### Using Custom Extractors

```bash
m1f-html2md convert ./html -o ./markdown \
  --extractor ./extractors/my_extractor.py
```

## Advanced Features

### Content Extraction with CSS Selectors

Target specific content areas:

```yaml
extractor:
  content_selector: |
    article.post-content,
    div.documentation-body,
    main[role="main"],
    #content:not(.sidebar)
```

### Link Handling Strategies

1. **Convert**: Change `.html` to `.md`

   ```yaml
   processor:
     link_handling: convert
     link_extensions:
       .html: .md
       .php: .md
   ```

2. **Preserve**: Keep original links

   ```yaml
   processor:
     link_handling: preserve
   ```

3. **Absolute**: Make all links absolute
   ```yaml
   processor:
     link_handling: absolute
   ```

### Metadata Extraction

The tool can extract and preserve:

- Page title
- Meta description
- OpenGraph data
- Schema.org structured data
- Custom meta tags

### m1f Bundle Creation

Generate m1f bundles directly:

```yaml
output_format: m1f_bundle
m1f:
  create_bundle: true
  bundle_name: my-documentation
  include_assets: true
  generate_index: true
  metadata:
    project: My Project Docs
    version: 1.0.0
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Convert Documentation Site

```bash
# Create configuration
cat > docs-config.yaml << EOF
source: ./python-docs-html
destination: ./python-docs-md
extractor:
  content_selector: "div.document"
  ignore_selectors:
    - ".sphinxsidebar"
    - ".related"
processor:
  heading_offset: 1
  add_frontmatter: true
parallel: true
EOF

# Run conversion
m1f-html2md convert ./python-docs-html -o ./python-docs-md -c docs-config.yaml
```

### Example 2: Convert Blog with Specific Content

```python
from tools.html2md.api import HTML2MDConverter
import asyncio

converter = HTML2MDConverter(
    outermost_selector="article.post",
    ignore_selectors=[
        ".post-navigation",
        ".comments-section",
        ".social-share"
    ],
    add_frontmatter=True,
    heading_offset=0
)

# Convert all blog posts (async)
results = asyncio.run(converter.convert_directory(
    "./blog-html",
    "./blog-markdown"
))
```

### Example 3: Create m1f Bundle from HTML

```bash
# First download the website using webscraper
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./html

# Then convert to m1f bundle
m1f-html2md convert ./html \
  -o ./output.m1f \
  --format m1f_bundle \
  --content-selector "main.content" \
  --ignore-selectors nav footer
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Content selector not matching**

   ```
   WARNING: Content selector 'article' not found
   ```

   Solution: Use the analyze command to find the right selectors:

   ```bash
   m1f-html2md analyze ./html/*.html --suggest-selectors
   ```

2. **Encoding issues**

   ```
   UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode
   ```

   Solution: The tool auto-detects encoding, but HTML files may have mixed
   encodings. All output is converted to UTF-8.

3. **Large directories timing out**

   Solution: Use parallel processing:

   ```bash
   m1f-html2md convert ./html -o ./md --parallel
   ```

4. **Missing content after conversion**

   Solution: Check your ignore selectors - they may be too broad:

   ```bash
   m1f-html2md convert ./html -o ./md \
     --content-selector "body" \
     --ignore-selectors .ads .cookie-notice
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for debugging:

```bash
m1f-html2md convert ./html -o ./md -v --log-file debug.log
```

Or in configuration:

```yaml
verbose: true
log_file: ./conversion-debug.log
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Use parallel processing** for large directories:

   ```yaml
   parallel: true
   ```

2. **Target specific content** to reduce processing:

   ```yaml
   extractor:
     content_selector: "article.documentation"
   ```

3. **Use custom extractors** for complex sites to optimize extraction

## Integration with m1f

The converted Markdown files are optimized for m1f bundling:

1. Clean, consistent formatting
2. Preserved metadata in frontmatter
3. Proper link structure
4. UTF-8 encoding

To create an m1f bundle after conversion:

```bash
# Download website first
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./html/

# Convert to Markdown
m1f-html2md convert ./html/ -o ./docs/

# Create m1f bundle
m1f -s ./docs/ -o documentation.m1f.txt
```

Or convert directly to m1f bundle format:

```bash
m1f-html2md convert ./html/ \
  -o ./docs.m1f \
  --format m1f_bundle
```

# HTML2MD Workflow Guide

This guide explains the recommended workflow for converting websites to Markdown
using html2md with custom extractors.

## Overview

The html2md tool now supports a flexible workflow that separates concerns:

1. HTML acquisition (scraping or external)
2. Content analysis and extractor development
3. Conversion with site-specific extraction

## Directory Structure

All scraping projects use the `.scrapes` directory (gitignored):

```
.scrapes/
└── project-name/
    ├── html/         # Raw HTML files
    ├── md/           # Converted Markdown files
    └── extractors/   # Custom extraction scripts
```

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Project Structure

```bash
# Create project directories
mkdir -p .scrapes/my-docs/{html,md,extractors}
```

### Step 2: Acquire HTML Content

You have several options:

#### Option A: Use webscraper tool

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com \
  -o .scrapes/my-docs/html \
  --max-pages 50 \
  --scraper playwright
```

#### Option B: Manual download

- Save HTML files directly to `.scrapes/my-docs/html/`
- Use browser "Save As" or wget/curl
- Any method that gets HTML files

#### Option C: External scraping

- Use any scraping tool you prefer
- Just ensure HTML files end up in the html/ directory

### Step 3: Analyze HTML Structure (Optional)

Understand the HTML structure before creating extractors:

```bash
# Analyze a few sample files
m1f-html2md analyze \
  .scrapes/my-docs/html/*.html \
  --suggest-selectors

# Get detailed structure analysis
m1f-html2md analyze \
  .scrapes/my-docs/html/*.html \
  --show-structure \
  --common-patterns
```

### Step 4: Create Custom Extractor (Optional)

#### Manual Creation

Create `.scrapes/my-docs/extractors/custom_extractor.py`:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
    """Extract main content from HTML."""
    # Remove site-specific navigation
    for selector in ['nav', '.sidebar', '#header', '#footer']:
        for elem in soup.select(selector):
            elem.decompose()

    # Find main content area
    main = soup.find('main') or soup.find('article') or soup.find('.content')
    if main:
        # Create clean soup with just main content
        new_soup = BeautifulSoup('<html><body></body></html>', 'html.parser')
        new_soup.body.append(main)
        return new_soup

    return soup

def postprocess(markdown: str, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
    """Clean up converted markdown."""
    lines = markdown.split('\n')
    cleaned = []

    for line in lines:
        # Remove "Copy" buttons before code blocks
        if line.strip() == 'Copy':
            continue

```

#### Claude-Assisted Creation

Use Claude to analyze HTML and create a custom extractor:

```bash
# Have Claude analyze the HTML structure
claude -p "Analyze these HTML files and create a custom extractor for html2md. \
The extractor should:
1. Remove all navigation, headers, footers, and sidebars
2. Extract only the main content
3. Clean up any site-specific artifacts in the markdown
4. Handle the specific structure of this website

Write the extractor to .scrapes/my-docs/extractors/custom_extractor.py" \
--files .scrapes/my-docs/html/*.html
```

### Step 5: Convert HTML to Markdown

#### With Custom Extractor

```bash
cd .scrapes/my-docs
m1f-html2md convert html -o md \
  --extractor extractors/custom_extractor.py
```

#### With Default Extractor

```bash
cd .scrapes/my-docs
m1f-html2md convert html -o md
```

#### With CSS Selectors Only

```bash
cd .scrapes/my-docs
m1f-html2md convert html -o md \
  --content-selector "main.content" \
  --ignore-selectors "nav" ".sidebar" ".ads"
```

### Step 6: Review and Refine

1. Check the converted Markdown files
2. If quality needs improvement:
   - Update the custom extractor
   - Re-run the conversion
   - Iterate until satisfied

## Example: Documentation Site

Here's a complete example for converting a documentation site:

```bash
# 1. Setup
mkdir -p .scrapes/docs-site/{html,md,extractors}

# 2. Download documentation
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com \
  -o .scrapes/docs-site/html \
  --max-pages 100 \
  --scraper playwright

# 3. Analyze structure
m1f-html2md analyze \
  .scrapes/docs-site/html/*.html \
  --suggest-selectors

# 4. Create extractor for docs site
cat > .scrapes/docs-site/extractors/docs_extractor.py << 'EOF'
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
    # Remove docs-specific elements
    for selector in [
        '.docs-nav', '.docs-sidebar', '.docs-header',
        '.docs-footer', '.edit-page', '.feedback',
        '[class*="navigation"]', '[id*="toc"]'
    ]:
        for elem in soup.select(selector):
            elem.decompose()

    # Extract article content
    article = soup.find('article') or soup.find('.docs-content')
    if article:
        new_soup = BeautifulSoup('<html><body></body></html>', 'html.parser')
        new_soup.body.append(article)
        return new_soup

    return soup

def postprocess(markdown: str, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
    # Clean up docs-specific patterns
    import re

    # Remove "Copy" buttons
    markdown = re.sub(r'^Copy\s*\n', '', markdown, flags=re.MULTILINE)

    # Remove "On this page" sections
    markdown = re.sub(r'^On this page.*?(?=^#|\Z)', '', markdown,
                      flags=re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)

    return markdown.strip()
EOF

# 5. Convert with custom extractor
cd .scrapes/docs-site
m1f-html2md convert html -o md \
  --extractor extractors/docs_extractor.py

# 6. Create m1f bundle (optional)
m1f -s md -o docs-bundle.txt
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

- Test with a few HTML files first
- Refine the extractor before processing everything

### 2. Iterative Development

- Create basic extractor
- Convert a sample
- Identify issues
- Update extractor
- Repeat until satisfied

### 3. Extractor Tips

- Use specific CSS selectors for the site
- Remove navigation early in extraction
- Handle site-specific patterns in postprocess
- Test with different page types

### 4. Organization

- Keep each project in its own directory
- Document site-specific quirks
- Save working extractors for reuse

### 5. Performance

- Use `--parallel` for large conversions
- Process in batches if needed
- Monitor memory usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Navigation elements still appear in Markdown

- **Solution**: Add more specific selectors to the extractor
- Check for dynamic class names or IDs

**Issue**: Missing content

- **Solution**: Verify content selector is correct
- Check if content is loaded dynamically (use playwright scraper)

**Issue**: Broken formatting

- **Solution**: Adjust extraction logic
- Use postprocess to fix patterns

**Issue**: Encoding errors

- **Solution**: Ensure HTML files are UTF-8
- Use `--target-encoding utf-8` if needed

### Debug Tips

1. **Test extractor standalone**:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from pathlib import Path

# Load your extractor
import sys
sys.path.append('.scrapes/my-docs/extractors')
import custom_extractor

# Test on single file
html = Path('.scrapes/my-docs/html/sample.html').read_text()
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
result = custom_extractor.extract(soup)
print(result.prettify())
```

2. **Use verbose mode**:

```bash
m1f-html2md convert html -o md \
  --extractor extractors/custom_extractor.py \
  --verbose
```

3. **Process single file**:

```bash
m1f-html2md convert html/single-file.html \
  -o test.md \
  --extractor extractors/custom_extractor.py
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Stage Extraction

For complex sites, use multiple extraction stages:

```python
def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
    # Stage 1: Remove obvious non-content
    remove_selectors = ['script', 'style', 'nav', 'header', 'footer']
    for selector in remove_selectors:
        for elem in soup.select(selector):
            elem.decompose()

    # Stage 2: Find content container
    container = soup.select_one('.main-container') or soup.body

    # Stage 3: Clean within container
    for elem in container.select('.ads, .social-share, .related'):
        elem.decompose()

    # Stage 4: Extract final content
    content = container.select_one('article') or container

    new_soup = BeautifulSoup('<html><body></body></html>', 'html.parser')
    new_soup.body.append(content)
    return new_soup
```

### Conditional Extraction

Handle different page types:

```python
def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
    # Detect page type
    if soup.find('article', class_='blog-post'):
        return extract_blog_post(soup)
    elif soup.find('div', class_='documentation'):
        return extract_documentation(soup)
    elif soup.find('div', class_='api-reference'):
        return extract_api_reference(soup)
    else:
        return extract_generic(soup)
```

### Metadata Preservation

Keep important metadata:

```python
def extract(soup: BeautifulSoup, config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BeautifulSoup:
    # Preserve title
    title = soup.find('title')

    # Extract content
    content = soup.find('main')

    # Create new soup with metadata
    new_soup = BeautifulSoup('<html><head></head><body></body></html>', 'html.parser')
    if title:
        new_soup.head.append(title)
    if content:
        new_soup.body.append(content)

    return new_soup
```

## Conclusion

The html2md workflow provides maximum flexibility:

- Separate HTML acquisition from conversion
- Site-specific extractors for optimal results
- Iterative refinement process
- Integration with other tools (webscraper, m1f)

This approach ensures you can handle any website structure and produce clean,
readable Markdown output.

======= docs/04_scrape/40_webscraper.md ======
# webscraper (Website Downloader)

A modern web scraping tool for downloading websites with multiple backend
options, async I/O, and intelligent crawling capabilities.

## Overview

The webscraper tool provides a robust solution for downloading websites for
offline viewing and analysis. Built with Python 3.10+ and modern async
architecture, it features pluggable scraper backends for different use cases.

**Primary Use Case**: Download online documentation to make it available to LLMs
(like Claude) for analysis and reference. The downloaded HTML files can be
converted to Markdown with html2md, then bundled into a single file with m1f for
optimal LLM context usage.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Scraper Backends**: Choose from BeautifulSoup (default), HTTrack,
  Scrapy, Playwright, or Selectolax
- **Async I/O**: High-performance concurrent downloading
- **Intelligent Crawling**: Automatically respects robots.txt, follows
  redirects, handles encoding
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Three-layer deduplication system:
  - Canonical URL checking (enabled by default)
  - Content-based deduplication (enabled by default)
  - GET parameter normalization (optional with `--ignore-get-params`)
- **Metadata Preservation**: Saves HTTP headers and metadata alongside HTML
  files
- **Domain Restriction**: Automatically restricts crawling to the starting
  domain
- **Subdirectory Restriction**: When URL contains a path, only scrapes within
  that subdirectory
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between requests
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with file listing
- **Resume Support**: Interrupt and resume scraping sessions with SQLite
  tracking

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic website download
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./downloaded_html

# Download with specific depth and page limits
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html \
  --max-pages 50 \
  --max-depth 3

# Use different scraper backend
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --scraper httrack

# List downloaded files after completion
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --list-files

# Resume interrupted scraping (with verbose mode to see progress)
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html -v
```

## Scraper Backends

### BeautifulSoup (default)

- **Best for**: General purpose scraping, simple websites
- **Features**: Fast HTML parsing, good encoding detection
- **Limitations**: No JavaScript support

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --scraper beautifulsoup
```

### HTTrack

- **Best for**: Complete website mirroring, preserving structure
- **Features**: External links handling, advanced mirroring options
- **Limitations**: Requires HTTrack to be installed separately

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --scraper httrack
```

### Scrapy

- **Best for**: Large-scale crawling, complex scraping rules
- **Features**: Advanced crawling settings, middleware support
- **Limitations**: More complex configuration

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --scraper scrapy
```

### Playwright

- **Best for**: JavaScript-heavy sites, SPAs
- **Features**: Full browser automation, JavaScript execution
- **Limitations**: Slower, requires more resources

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --scraper playwright
```

### Selectolax

- **Best for**: Speed-critical applications
- **Features**: Fastest HTML parsing, minimal overhead
- **Limitations**: Basic feature set

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --scraper selectolax
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Website Download

```bash
# Download a simple website
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./docs_html

# Download with verbose output
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./docs_html -v
```

### Canonical URL Checking

By default, the scraper checks for canonical URLs to avoid downloading duplicate
content:

```bash
# Pages with different canonical URLs are automatically skipped
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html

# Ignore canonical tags if you want all page versions
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --ignore-canonical
```

When enabled (default), the scraper:

- Checks the `<link rel="canonical">` tag on each page
- Skips pages where the canonical URL differs from the current URL
- Prevents downloading duplicate content (e.g., print versions, mobile versions)
- Logs skipped pages with their canonical URLs for transparency

This is especially useful for sites that have multiple URLs pointing to the same
content.

### Content Deduplication

By default, the scraper detects and skips pages with duplicate content based on
text-only checksums:

```bash
# Content deduplication is enabled by default
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html

# Disable content deduplication if needed
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html --ignore-duplicates
```

This feature:

- Enabled by default to avoid downloading duplicate content
- Extracts plain text from HTML (removes all tags, scripts, styles)
- Calculates SHA-256 checksum of the normalized text
- Skips pages with identical text content
- Useful for sites with multiple URLs serving the same content
- Works together with canonical URL checking for thorough deduplication

The scraper now has three levels of duplicate prevention, applied in this order:

1. **GET parameter normalization** (default: disabled) - Use
   `--ignore-get-params` to enable
2. **Canonical URL checking** (default: enabled) - Respects
   `<link rel="canonical">`
3. **Content deduplication** (default: enabled) - Compares text content

**Important**: All deduplication data is stored in the SQLite database
(`scrape_tracker.db`), which means:

- Content checksums persist across resume operations
- Canonical URL information is saved for each page
- The deduplication works correctly even when resuming interrupted scrapes
- Memory-efficient: checksums are queried from database, not loaded into memory
- Scales to large websites without excessive memory usage

### Subdirectory Restriction

When you specify a URL with a path, the scraper automatically restricts crawling
to that subdirectory:

```bash
# Only scrape pages under /docs subdirectory
m1f-scrape https://example.com/docs -o ./docs_only

# Only scrape API documentation pages
m1f-scrape https://api.example.com/v2/reference -o ./api_docs

# This will NOT scrape /products, /blog, etc. - only /tutorials/*
m1f-scrape https://learn.example.com/tutorials -o ./tutorials_only
```

### Controlled Crawling

```bash
# Limit crawl depth for shallow scraping
m1f-scrape https://blog.example.com -o ./blog \
  --max-depth 2 \
  --max-pages 20

# Slow crawling to be respectful
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html \
  --request-delay 2.0 \
  --concurrent-requests 2
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Use custom user agent
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html \
  --user-agent "MyBot/1.0 (Compatible)"

# Use scraper-specific configuration
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o ./html \
  --scraper scrapy \
  --scraper-config ./scrapy-settings.yaml
```

## Output Structure

Downloaded files are organized to mirror the website structure:

```
output_directory/
├── scrape_tracker.db         # SQLite database for resume functionality
├── example.com/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.meta.json
│   ├── about/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── index.meta.json
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── post1/
│   │   │   ├── index.html
│   │   │   └── index.meta.json
│   │   └── post2/
│   │       ├── index.html
│   │       └── index.meta.json
│   └── contact/
│       ├── index.html
│       └── index.meta.json
```

### Metadata Files

Each HTML file has an accompanying `.meta.json` file containing:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/about/",
  "title": "About Us - Example",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "status_code": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
    "Last-Modified": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Learn more about Example company",
    "og:title": "About Us",
    "canonical": "https://example.com/about/"
  }
}
```

## Integration with m1f Workflow

webscraper is designed as the first step in a workflow to provide documentation
to LLMs:

```bash
# Step 1: Download documentation website
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./html_files

# Step 2: Analyze HTML structure
m1f-html2md analyze ./html_files/*.html --suggest-selectors

# Step 3: Convert to Markdown
m1f-html2md convert ./html_files -o ./markdown \
  --content-selector "main.content" \
  --ignore-selectors "nav" ".sidebar"

# Step 4: Bundle for LLM consumption
m1f -s ./markdown -o ./docs_bundle.txt \
  --remove-scraped-metadata

# Now docs_bundle.txt contains all documentation in a single file
# that can be provided to Claude or other LLMs for analysis
```

### Complete Documentation Download Example

```bash
# Download React documentation for LLM analysis
m1f-scrape https://react.dev/learn -o ./react_docs \
  --max-pages 100 \
  --max-depth 3

# Convert to clean Markdown
m1f-html2md convert ./react_docs -o ./react_md \
  --content-selector "article" \
  --ignore-selectors "nav" "footer" ".sidebar"

# Create single file for LLM
m1f -s ./react_md -o ./react_documentation.txt

# Now you can provide react_documentation.txt to Claude:
# "Here is the React documentation: <contents of react_documentation.txt>"
```

## Resume Functionality

The scraper supports interrupting and resuming downloads, making it ideal for
large websites or unreliable connections.

### How It Works

- **SQLite Database**: Creates `scrape_tracker.db` in the output directory to
  track:
  - URL of each scraped page
  - HTTP status code and target filename
  - Timestamp and error messages (if any)
- **Progress Display**: Shows real-time progress in verbose mode:
  ```
  Processing: https://example.com/page1 (page 1)
  Processing: https://example.com/page2 (page 2)
  ```
- **Graceful Interruption**: Press Ctrl+C to interrupt cleanly:
  ```
  Press Ctrl+C to interrupt and resume later
  ^C
  ⚠️  Scraping interrupted by user
  Run the same command again to resume where you left off
  ```

### Resume Example

```bash
# Start scraping with verbose mode
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./docs --max-pages 100 -v

# Interrupt with Ctrl+C when needed
# Resume by running the exact same command:
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o ./docs --max-pages 100 -v

# You'll see:
# Resuming crawl - found 25 previously scraped URLs
# Populating queue from previously scraped pages...
# Found 187 URLs to visit after analyzing scraped pages
# Processing: https://docs.example.com/new-page (page 26)
```

### Database Inspection

```bash
# Show scraping statistics
m1f-scrape -o docs/ --show-db-stats

# View all scraped URLs with status codes
m1f-scrape -o docs/ --show-scraped-urls

# Check for errors
m1f-scrape -o docs/ --show-errors

# Combine multiple queries
m1f-scrape -o docs/ --show-db-stats --show-errors
```

## Best Practices

1. **Respect robots.txt**: The tool automatically respects robots.txt files
2. **Use appropriate delays**: Set `--request-delay` to avoid overwhelming
   servers (default: 15 seconds)
3. **Limit concurrent requests**: Use `--concurrent-requests` responsibly
   (default: 2 connections)
4. **Test with small crawls**: Start with `--max-pages 10` to test your settings
5. **Check output**: Use `--list-files` to verify what was downloaded
6. **Use verbose mode**: Add `-v` flag to see progress and resume information
7. **Keep commands consistent**: Use the exact same command to resume a session

## Dealing with Cloudflare Protection

Many websites use Cloudflare or similar services to protect against bots. The
scraper now includes conservative defaults to help avoid detection:

### Default Conservative Settings

- **Request delay**: 15 seconds between requests
- **Concurrent requests**: 2 simultaneous connections
- **HTTrack backend**: Limited to 0.5 connections/second max
- **Bandwidth limiting**: 100KB/s for HTTrack backend
- **Robots.txt**: Always respected (cannot be disabled)

### For Heavy Cloudflare Protection

For heavily protected sites, manually set very conservative values:

```bash
m1f-scrape https://protected-site.com -o ./output \
  --request-delay 30 \
  --concurrent-requests 1 \
  --max-pages 50 \
  --scraper httrack
```

### Cloudflare Avoidance Tips

1. **Start conservative**: Begin with 30-60 second delays
2. **Use realistic user agents**: The default is a current Chrome browser
3. **Limit scope**: Download only what you need with `--max-pages`
4. **Single connection**: Use `--concurrent-requests 1` for sensitive sites
5. **Respect robots.txt**: Always enabled by default
6. **Add randomness**: Consider adding random delays in custom scripts

### When Cloudflare Still Blocks

If conservative settings don't work:

1. **Try Playwright backend**: Uses real browser automation

   ```bash
   m1f-scrape https://site.com -o ./output --scraper playwright
   ```

2. **Manual download**: Some sites require manual browsing
3. **API access**: Check if the site offers an API
4. **Contact site owner**: Request permission or access

## Troubleshooting

### No files downloaded

- Check if the website blocks automated access
- Try a different scraper backend
- Verify the URL is accessible

### Incomplete downloads

- Increase `--max-depth` if pages are deeply nested
- Increase `--max-pages` if hitting the limit
- Check for JavaScript-rendered content (use Playwright)

### Encoding issues

- The tool automatically detects encoding
- Check `.meta.json` files for encoding information
- Use html2md with proper encoding settings for conversion

  --max-depth 5 \
  --concurrent-requests 8
```

## Configuration Options

### Command Line Options

Common options for all scrapers:

```bash
--scraper BACKEND           # Choose scraper backend (beautifulsoup, bs4, httrack,
                           # selectolax, httpx, scrapy, playwright)
--max-depth N               # Maximum crawl depth (default: 5)
--max-pages N               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 1000)
--request-delay SECONDS     # Delay between requests (default: 15.0)
--concurrent-requests N     # Number of concurrent requests (default: 2)
--user-agent STRING         # Custom user agent
--scraper-config PATH       # Path to scraper-specific config file (YAML/JSON)
--list-files                # List all downloaded files after completion
-v, --verbose               # Enable verbose output
-q, --quiet                 # Suppress all output except errors
--version                   # Show version information
```

Note: robots.txt is always respected and cannot be disabled.

### Configuration File

You can specify scraper-specific settings in a YAML or JSON configuration file:

```yaml
# beautifulsoup-config.yaml
parser: "html.parser" # Options: "html.parser", "lxml", "html5lib"
features: "lxml"
encoding: "auto" # Or specific encoding like "utf-8"
```

```yaml
# httrack-config.yaml
mirror_options:
  - "--assume-insecure" # For HTTPS issues
  - "--robots=3" # Strict robots.txt compliance
extra_filters:
  - "+*.css"
  - "+*.js"
  - "-*.zip"
```

Use with:

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o output/ \
  --scraper beautifulsoup \
  --scraper-config beautifulsoup-config.yaml
```

### Backend-Specific Configuration

Each backend can have specific configuration options:

#### BeautifulSoup Configuration

Create a `beautifulsoup.yaml`:

```yaml
scraper_config:
  parser: "lxml" # Options: "html.parser", "lxml", "html5lib"
  features: "lxml"
  encoding: "auto" # Or specific encoding like "utf-8"
```

#### HTTrack Configuration

Create a `httrack.yaml`:

```yaml
scraper_config:
  mirror_options:
    - "--assume-insecure" # For HTTPS issues
    - "--robots=3" # Strict robots.txt compliance
  extra_filters:
    - "+*.css"
    - "+*.js"
    - "-*.zip"
```

## Use Cases and Recommendations

### Static Documentation Sites

For sites with mostly static HTML content:

```bash
m1f-scrape https://docs.example.com -o docs/ \
  --scraper beautifulsoup \
  --max-depth 10 \
  --request-delay 0.2
```

### Complete Website Backup

For creating a complete offline mirror:

```bash
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o backup/ \
  --scraper httrack \
  --max-pages 10000
```

### Rate-Limited APIs

For sites with strict rate limits:

```bash
m1f-scrape https://api.example.com/docs -o api-docs/ \
  --scraper beautifulsoup \
  --request-delay 2.0 \
  --concurrent-requests 1
```

## Troubleshooting

### BeautifulSoup Issues

**Encoding Problems:**

```bash
# Create a config file with UTF-8 encoding
echo 'encoding: utf-8' > bs-config.yaml
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o output/ \
  --scraper beautifulsoup \
  --scraper-config bs-config.yaml
```

**Parser Issues:**

```bash
# Create a config file with different parser
echo 'parser: html5lib' > bs-config.yaml
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o output/ \
  --scraper beautifulsoup \
  --scraper-config bs-config.yaml
```

### HTTrack Issues

**SSL Certificate Problems:**

```bash
# Create a config file to ignore SSL errors (use with caution)
echo 'mirror_options: ["--assume-insecure"]' > httrack-config.yaml
m1f-scrape https://example.com -o output/ \
  --scraper httrack \
  --scraper-config httrack-config.yaml
```

**Incomplete Downloads:** HTTrack creates a cache that allows resuming. Check
the `.httrack` directory in your output folder.

## Performance Comparison

| Backend       | Speed     | Memory Usage | JavaScript | Accuracy  |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| BeautifulSoup | Fast      | Low          | No         | High      |
| HTTrack       | Medium    | Medium       | No         | Very High |
| Selectolax    | Fastest   | Very Low     | No         | Medium    |
| Scrapy        | Very Fast | Low-Medium   | No         | High      |
| Playwright    | Slow      | High         | Yes        | Very High |

# For SPA with wait conditions
m1f-scrape https://spa-example.com -o output/ \
  --scraper playwright \
  --request-delay 2.0 \
  --concurrent-requests 2
```

## API Usage

You can also use the scraper backends programmatically:

```python
import asyncio
from tools.html2md.scrapers import create_scraper, ScraperConfig

async def scrape_example():
    # Configure scraper
    config = ScraperConfig(
        max_depth=5,
        max_pages=100,
        request_delay=0.5
    )

    # Create scraper instance
    scraper = create_scraper('beautifulsoup', config)

    # Scrape single page
    async with scraper:
        page = await scraper.scrape_url('https://example.com')
        print(f"Title: {page.title}")
        print(f"Content length: {len(page.content)}")

    # Scrape entire site
    async with scraper:
        async for page in scraper.scrape_site('https://example.com'):
            print(f"Scraped: {page.url}")

# Run the example
asyncio.run(scrape_example())
```

# Version Management

This project uses centralized version management to ensure consistency across
all components.

## Structure

- **Single Source of Truth**: `tools/_version.py`
- **Automatic Syncing**: Scripts to keep all files in sync
- **Dynamic Imports**: All modules import from the central version file

## Files That Use Version

1. **Python Modules**:

   - `tools/__init__.py` - imports from `_version.py`
   - `tools/m1f/__init__.py` - imports from `../_version.py`
   - `tools/s1f/__init__.py` - imports from `../_version.py`
   - `tools/html2md/__init__.py` - imports from `../_version.py`
   - `tools/webscraper/__init__.py` - imports from `../_version.py`

2. **Setup Files**:

   - `tools/setup.py` - reads version dynamically from `_version.py`

3. **NPM Package**:

   - `package.json` - synced using `sync_version.py`

4. **Main Script**:
   - `tools/m1f.py` - imports with fallback for standalone usage

## Updating Version

### Manual Update

1. Edit `tools/_version.py` and change the version
2. Run `python scripts/sync_version.py` to sync with package.json

### Using Bump Script

```bash
# Bump patch version (3.1.0 → 3.1.1)
python scripts/bump_version.py patch

# Bump minor version (3.1.0 → 3.2.0)
python scripts/bump_version.py minor

# Bump major version (3.1.0 → 4.0.0)
python scripts/bump_version.py major

# Set specific version
python scripts/bump_version.py 3.2.0-beta1
```

The bump script will:

1. Update `tools/_version.py`
2. Automatically sync `package.json`
3. Display next steps for committing and tagging

## Benefits

1. **Single Update Point**: Change version in one place only
2. **Consistency**: All components always have the same version
3. **Automation**: Scripts handle syncing and validation
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new files that need version info

## Adding New Components

When adding a new tool or module that needs version info:

1. Import from the parent package:

   ```python
   from .._version import __version__, __version_info__
   ```

2. No need to update sync scripts - they work automatically

## Version Format

- Follows semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Pre-release versions supported: `3.2.0-beta1`
- `__version__`: String format (e.g., "3.1.0")
- `__version_info__`: Tuple format (e.g., (3, 1, 0))

# m1f Git Hooks Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up Git hooks for automatic m1f bundle generation
in your projects.

## Overview

The m1f Git pre-commit hook automatically runs `m1f-update` before each commit,
ensuring that your bundled files are always up-to-date with your source code.

## Features

- **Automatic bundle generation** - Bundles are regenerated on every commit
- **Fail-safe commits** - Commits are blocked if bundle generation fails
- **Auto-staging** - Generated bundles in the `m1f/` directory are automatically
  added to commits
- **Conditional execution** - Only runs if `.m1f.config.yml` exists in your
  project

## Installation

### Method 1: Using the Installation Script (Recommended)

1. Navigate to your project root (where `.m1f.config.yml` is located)
2. Run the installation script:

```bash
# Download and run the installation script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franzundfranz/m1f/main/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh | bash

# Or if you have the m1f repository cloned
bash /path/to/m1f/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The script will:

- Check if you're in a Git repository
- Install the pre-commit hook
- Backup any existing pre-commit hook
- Make the hook executable

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Create the pre-commit hook file:

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# m1f Auto-Bundle Git Pre-Commit Hook

if [ -f ".m1f.config.yml" ]; then
    if ! command -v m1f &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Error: m1f command not found!"
        echo "Please install m1f: pip install m1f"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "Running m1f-update..."
    if m1f-update; then
        echo "Auto-bundle completed successfully."
        [ -d "m1f" ] && git add m1f/*
    else
        echo "Auto-bundle failed. Please fix the issues before committing."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
exit 0
EOF
```

2. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## How It Works

When you run `git commit`, the pre-commit hook:

1. Checks if `.m1f.config.yml` exists in your repository
2. Verifies that the `m1f` command is available
3. If both conditions are met, runs `m1f-update`
4. If bundle generation succeeds:
   - Adds all files in the `m1f/` directory to the commit
   - Allows the commit to proceed
5. If bundle generation fails:
   - Displays the error message
   - Blocks the commit
   - You must fix the issues before committing

## Usage

Once installed, the hook works automatically:

```bash
# Normal commit - bundles are generated automatically
git add your-files.py
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Skip the hook if needed
git commit --no-verify -m "wip: quick save"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook not running

1. Check if the hook is executable:

   ```bash
   ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

2. Make it executable if needed:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

### Bundle generation fails

1. Run auto-bundle manually to see the error:

   ```bash
   m1f-update
   ```

2. Fix any issues in your `.m1f.config.yml`

3. Try committing again

### m1f command not found

If you get "m1f command not found", ensure m1f is installed:

```bash
pip install m1f
# or for development
pip install -e /path/to/m1f
```

### Disable the hook temporarily

Use the `--no-verify` flag:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

### Remove the hook

To uninstall the pre-commit hook:

```bash
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Best Practices

1. **Include m1f/ in version control** - This ensures bundled files are
   available to all team members and AI tools

2. **Review bundle changes** - Check the generated bundles in your diffs before
   committing

3. **Keep bundles focused** - Configure smaller, specific bundles rather than
   one large bundle

4. **Use bundle groups** - Organize related bundles into groups for better
   management

## Example Workflow

1. Set up your project with m1f:

   ```bash
   m1f-link  # Create documentation symlink
   ```

2. Create `.m1f.config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   bundles:
     project-docs:
       description: "Project documentation"
       output: "m1f/docs.txt"
       sources:
         - path: "docs"
           include_extensions: [".md"]
   ```

3. Install the Git hook:

   ```bash
   bash /path/to/m1f/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
   ```

4. Work normally - bundles update automatically:
   ```bash
   echo "# New Feature" > docs/feature.md
   git add docs/feature.md
   git commit -m "docs: add feature documentation"
   # Bundle is regenerated and included in the commit
   ```

## Integration with CI/CD

The pre-commit hook ensures local development stays in sync. For CI/CD
pipelines, you can also run auto-bundle as a build step:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Install m1f
  run: pip install m1f

- name: Generate m1f bundles
  run: m1f-update
```

```bash
# GitLab CI example
before_script:
  - pip install m1f

bundle:
  script:
    - m1f-update
```

# token_counter - Token Estimation Tool

The token_counter tool (v2.0.0) estimates token usage for LLM context planning,
helping you optimize your use of large language models by managing context
window limits.

## Overview

When working with LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or GPT-4, understanding token
consumption is essential for effective prompt engineering and context
management. Built with Python 3.10+, the token_counter tool allows you to
precisely measure how many tokens your combined files will use, helping you stay
within the context window limits of your chosen LLM.

## Key Features

- Uses OpenAI's tiktoken library for accurate estimates
- Supports different encoding schemes for various LLMs
- Helps optimize context usage for LLMs
- Simple command-line interface

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check token count of a file
m1f-token-counter ./combined.txt

# Use a specific encoding model
m1f-token-counter ./combined.txt -e p50k_base
```

## Command Line Options

| Option           | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `file_path`      | Path to the text file to analyze                    |
| `-e, --encoding` | The tiktoken encoding to use (default: cl100k_base) |

## Usage Examples

Basic usage with default encoding (cl100k_base, used by GPT-4 and ChatGPT):

```bash
m1f-token-counter combined_output.txt
```

Using a specific encoding:

```bash
m1f-token-counter myfile.txt -e p50k_base
```

## Encoding Models

The tool supports different encoding models depending on which LLM you're using:

- `cl100k_base` - Default, used by GPT-4, ChatGPT
- `p50k_base` - Used by GPT-3.5-Turbo, text-davinci-003
- `r50k_base` - Used by older GPT-3 models

## Token Limits by Model

Understanding token limits is crucial for effective usage:

| Model           | Token Limit | Recommended Encoding |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| GPT-4 Turbo     | 128,000     | cl100k_base          |
| GPT-4           | 8,192       | cl100k_base          |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo   | 16,385      | cl100k_base          |
| Claude 3.5 Opus | 200,000     | -                    |
| Claude 3 Opus   | 200,000     | -                    |
| Claude 3 Sonnet | 200,000     | -                    |
| Claude 3 Haiku  | 200,000     | -                    |

## Integration with m1f

The token_counter tool is particularly useful when used with m1f to check if
your combined files will fit within the token limit of your chosen LLM:

1. First, combine files with m1f:

   ```bash
   m1f -s ./project -o ./combined.txt --include-extensions .py .js
   ```

2. Then, check the token count:
   ```bash
   m1f-token-counter ./combined.txt
   ```

This workflow helps you adjust your file selection to stay within token limits
for your AI assistant.

## Optimizing Token Usage

To reduce token consumption while maintaining context quality:

1. **Be selective with files**: Include only the most relevant files for your
   prompt
2. **Use minimal separator style**: The `None` separator style uses fewer tokens
3. **Trim unnecessary content**: Remove comments, unused code, or redundant text
4. **Focus on key files**: Prioritize files that directly address your question
5. **Use file filtering**: Utilize m1f's filtering options to target specific
   files

## Architecture

Token counter v2.0.0 features a simple but effective design:

- **Module Structure**: Can be run as a module (`m1f-token-counter`)
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of encoding errors and file issues
- **Performance**: Efficient token counting for large files

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- The `tiktoken` Python package:

```bash
pip install tiktoken
```

This dependency is included in the project's requirements.txt file.

## Tips for Accurate Token Counting

1. **Model-Specific Encoding**: Always use the encoding that matches your target
   LLM
2. **Include Prompts**: Remember to count tokens in your prompts as well as the
   context
3. **Buffer Space**: Leave 10-20% buffer for model responses
4. **Regular Checks**: Re-check token counts after file modifications

# HTML Structure Analysis for Optimal Content Extraction

use deep thinking The user wants a more systematic approach:

1. Create a task list
2. Analyze each file individually and save results
3. Then synthesize all analyses into final config This will produce much better
   results than trying to analyze all files at once.

## Context

The file m1f/selected_html_files.txt contains representative HTML files from the
documentation site.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Individual File Analysis

For each HTML file listed in m1f/selected_html_files.txt:

1. **Read the file** using the Read tool
2. **Perform deep structural analysis** (see analysis criteria below)
3. **Write detailed findings** to a separate analysis file:
   - File 1 → Write analysis to m1f/analysis/html_analysis_1.txt
   - File 2 → Write analysis to m1f/analysis/html_analysis_2.txt
   - etc. (continue for all files in the list)

### Phase 2: Synthesis

4. **Read all analysis files** (m1f/analysis/html_analysis_1.txt through
   m1f/analysis/html_analysis_N.txt where N is the number of files analyzed)
5. **Identify common patterns** across all analyses
6. **Create final YAML configuration** based on the synthesized findings

## Deep Analysis Criteria for Each File

When analyzing each HTML file, document:

### 1. Content Structure

```
Main Content Location:
- Primary container: [exact selector]
- Parent hierarchy: [body > ... > main]
- Semantic tags used: [main, article, section, etc.]
- Content-specific classes: [.content, .prose, .markdown-body, etc.]
- Content boundaries: [where content starts/ends]
```

### 2. Navigation & UI Elements

```
Elements to Exclude:
- Header/Navigation: [selectors]
- Sidebar: [selectors]
- Footer: [selectors]
- Breadcrumbs: [selectors]
- TOC/Page outline: [selectors]
- Meta information: [selectors]
- Interactive widgets: [selectors]
```

### 3. Special Content Types

```
Within Main Content:
- Code blocks: [how they're marked]
- Callout boxes: [info, warning, tip patterns]
- Tables: [table wrapper classes]
- Images/Media: [figure elements, wrappers]
- Examples/Demos: [interactive elements to preserve]
```

### 4. Page-Specific Observations

```
Page Type: [landing/guide/api/reference]
Unique Patterns: [anything specific to this page]
Potential Issues: [edge cases noticed]
```

## Analysis File Format

Each analysis file (m1f/analysis/html_analysis_N.txt) should follow this format:

```
FILE: [filename]
URL PATH: [relative path]

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
- Main container: [selector]
- Backup selectors: [alternatives if main doesn't work]
- Content confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

EXCLUDE PATTERNS:
- Navigation: [selectors]
- UI Chrome: [selectors]
- Metadata: [selectors]

SPECIAL FINDINGS:
- [Any unique patterns]
- [Edge cases]
- [Warnings]

SUGGESTED SELECTORS:
content_selector: "[primary selector]"
alternative_selectors:
  - "[fallback 1]"
  - "[fallback 2]"
ignore_selectors:
  - "[exclude 1]"
  - "[exclude 2]"
  - "[exclude 3]"
```

## Final Output

After analyzing all files and reading the analysis results, create the file
m1f_extract.yml

The file should have the results of you analyses and have this structure:

````yaml
# Complete configuration file for m1f-html2md
# All sections are optional - only include what differs from defaults

# Source and destination paths (usually provided via CLI)

````

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:

1. Complete ALL tasks in the task list sequentially
2. The individual analysis files are crucial for creating an accurate final
   configuration
3. **NEVER use empty strings** ("") as selectors - every selector must have
   actual content
4. **Remove any empty or whitespace-only selectors** from lists before
   outputting
5. **Validate all selectors** are non-empty and properly formatted CSS selectors

**FILE MANAGEMENT**:

- Use Write tool to create analysis files in m1f/analysis/ directory as
  specified
- You may create temporary files if needed for analysis
- **IMPORTANT**: Clean up ALL temporary files you have created
- Only keep the required analysis files: m1f/analysis/html_analysis_1.txt
  through m1f/analysis/html_analysis_N.txt (where N is the number of files
  analyzed)
- Delete any .py, .sh, or other temporary files you create during analysis

# Convert HTML to Clean, High-Quality Markdown

## Context:

You are converting scraped documentation HTML to clean Markdown. The HTML may
contain navigation, ads, and other non-content elements that must be excluded.

## Content Extraction Rules:

### INCLUDE:

- Main article/documentation content
- Headings within the content area
- Code blocks and inline code
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Tables
- Images with their alt text
- Links (convert to Markdown format)
- Blockquotes
- Important callouts/alerts within content

### EXCLUDE:

- Site navigation (top nav, sidebars, breadcrumbs)
- Headers and footers outside main content
- "Edit this page" or "Improve this doc" links
- Social sharing buttons
- Comment sections
- Related articles/suggestions
- Newsletter signup forms
- Cookie notices
- JavaScript-rendered placeholders
- Meta information (unless part of the content flow)
- Table of contents (unless embedded in content)
- Page view counters
- Advertisements

## Markdown Quality Standards:

### 1. Structure Preservation

- Maintain the original heading hierarchy
- Don't skip heading levels
- Preserve the logical flow of information

### 2. Code Formatting

````markdown
# Inline code

Use `backticks` for inline code, commands, or file names

# Code blocks

​`language code here ​`

# Shell commands

​`bash $ command here ​`
````

### 3. Special Content Types

**API Endpoints:** Format as inline code: `GET /api/v1/users`

**File Paths:** Format as inline code: `/etc/config.yaml`

**Callout Boxes:** Convert to blockquotes with type indicators:

> **Note:** Important information **Warning:** Critical warning **Tip:** Helpful
> suggestion

**Tables:** Use clean Markdown table syntax with proper alignment

### 4. Link Handling

- Convert relative links to proper Markdown: `[text](url)`
- Preserve anchor links: `[Section](#section-id)`
- Remove dead or navigation-only links

### 5. Image Handling

- Use descriptive alt text: `![Description of image](image-url)`
- If no alt text exists, describe the image content
- Skip purely decorative images

## Final Quality Checklist:

- ✓ No HTML tags remaining
- ✓ No broken Markdown syntax
- ✓ Clean, readable formatting
- ✓ Proper spacing between sections
- ✓ Consistent code block language tags
- ✓ No duplicate content
- ✓ No navigation elements
- ✓ Logical content flow preserved

# Strategic HTML File Selection for CSS Selector Analysis

From the list of available HTML files provided above, select the most
representative files for CSS selector analysis.

## Your Mission:

Select exactly 5 representative HTML files that will give us the BEST insight
into the site's structure for creating robust CSS selectors.

## Selection Strategy:

### 1. Diversity is Key

Choose files that represent different:

- **Sections**: API docs, guides, tutorials, references, landing pages
- **Depths**: Root level, deeply nested, mid-level pages
- **Layouts**: Different page templates if identifiable from paths

### 2. Pattern Recognition

Look for URL patterns that suggest content types:

- `/api/` or `/reference/` → API documentation
- `/guide/` or `/tutorial/` → Step-by-step content
- `/docs/` → General documentation
- `/blog/` or `/changelog/` → Time-based content
- `index.html` → Section landing pages
- Long paths with multiple segments → Detailed topic pages

### 3. Avoid Redundancy

Skip:

- Multiple files from the same directory pattern
- Obviously auto-generated sequences (e.g., /api/v1/method1, /api/v1/method2)
- Redirect or error pages if identifiable

### 4. Prioritize High-Value Pages

Select files that likely have:

- Rich content structure (not just navigation pages)
- Different content layouts
- Representative examples of the site's documentation style

## Output Format:

Return EXACTLY 5 file paths, one per line. No explanations, no formatting, no
numbering. Do not include any text before or after the file paths. Just the file
paths, nothing else.

Example format: docs/getting-started/index.html
api/reference/authentication.html guides/advanced/performance-tuning.html
tutorials/quickstart.html concepts/architecture/overview.html

IMPORTANT: After listing the files, print "FILE_SELECTION_COMPLETE_OK" on the
last line to confirm completion.

# Configuration Synthesis from Individual File Analyses

You have analyzed multiple HTML files individually. Now synthesize their
findings into a unified configuration that will be saved as
`html2md_config.yaml`.

## Your Task

Read the analysis files:

- m1f/analysis/html_analysis_1.txt
- m1f/analysis/html_analysis_2.txt
- m1f/analysis/html_analysis_3.txt
- m1f/analysis/html_analysis_4.txt
- m1f/analysis/html_analysis_5.txt

Based on these analyses, create an optimal YAML configuration that works across
all files.

## Analysis Process

1. **Read all 5 analysis files**
2. **Identify common patterns** across analyses
3. **Find selectors that work on multiple files**
4. **Create prioritized fallback selectors**
5. **Combine all exclusion patterns**

## Output YAML Configuration

Create a YAML configuration in this exact format:

````yaml
# Complete configuration file for m1f-html2md
# All sections are optional - only include what differs from defaults

# Source and destination paths (usually provided via CLI)

````

## Selection Criteria

**Primary Content Selector**:

- Choose selector that works on most files (80%+ coverage)
- If no single selector works on most, combine multiple with commas
- Prefer semantic selectors (main, article) over class-based

**Alternative Selectors**:

- Order by coverage (most files first)
- Include at least one generic fallback
- Each should be valid CSS selector

**Ignore Selectors**:

- Include selectors found in majority of files
- Group by type (navigation, headers, footers, etc.)
- Add comments showing coverage (found in X/N files)

**Critical Requirements**:

1. **NEVER include empty strings** ("") in any selector list
2. **All selectors must be valid CSS selectors**
3. **Remove whitespace-only entries**
4. **Test that primary selector + alternatives provide good coverage**
5. **Ensure ignore selectors don't accidentally exclude wanted content**

Output only the YAML configuration - no additional explanation needed.

# 🎯 CREATE PERFECT TOPIC-SPECIFIC BUNDLES FOR THIS PROJECT

The basic bundles (complete.txt and docs.txt) have already been created. Now
create additional topic-specific bundles following BEST PRACTICES.

📚 REQUIRED READING (IN THIS ORDER):

1. READ: @m1f/m1f.txt for m1f documentation and bundle configuration syntax
2. READ: @m1f/project_analysis_dirlist.txt for directory structure
3. READ: @m1f/project_analysis_filelist.txt for complete file listing

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read ALL three files above before proceeding!

🏆 BEST PRACTICES FOR PERFECT BUNDLES:

1. **SIZE GUIDELINES** - Optimize for different use cases!

   - Claude Code: Ideally under 180KB per bundle for best performance
   - Claude AI: Ideally under 5MB per bundle
   - Complete/full bundles can be larger (even 40MB+) for comprehensive analysis
   - Split large topics into focused bundles when targeting specific tasks

2. **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE** - One bundle per logical module/tool/service

3. **USE PRECISE INCLUDES** - Don't exclude everything except what you want!
   Instead, use precise 'includes' patterns:

   ```yaml
   sources:
     - path: "src/auth"
       include_extensions: [".ts", ".js"]
     - path: "shared"
       includes: ["auth-utils.ts", "auth-types.ts"]
   ```

   For documentation chapters/sections:

   ```yaml
   sources:
     - path: "src" # Use "src" not "src/"
       includes: ["ch04-*.md", "chapter-04/*.md"]
     - path: "." # Use "." for root directory
       includes: ["README.md", "CONTRIBUTING.md"]
   ```

4. **HIERARCHICAL NAMING** - Use category-number-topic pattern:

   - api-01-core-basics
   - api-02-core-advanced
   - guide-01-getting-started

5. **ESSENTIAL BUNDLES** - Always include:
   - quick-reference (< 180KB)
   - common-errors (< 180KB)
   - best-practices (< 180KB)

🚨 CRITICAL RULES:

1. FOLLOW SIZE GUIDELINES - Create focused bundles under 180KB for Claude Code
   when possible
2. NO DEFAULT EXCLUDES (node_modules, .git, **pycache**, vendor/ already
   excluded)
3. NO IMAGE/BINARY BUNDLES
4. MAXIMUM 30-40 bundles (more granular = better for targeted AI assistance)
5. Each bundle should be SELF-CONTAINED and appropriately sized for its purpose
6. ALWAYS TEST YOUR PATHS - Verify directories exist before adding to config
7. USE RELATIVE PATHS from project root (not absolute paths)

📋 ALREADY CREATED BUNDLES:

- complete: Full project bundle
- docs: All documentation files

🔍 PROJECT ANALYSIS STEPS:

STEP 1: Identify Architecture Type

- Monorepo? → Bundle per package
- Multi-app? → Bundle per app + shared bundles
- Plugin system? → Bundle per plugin + core
- Modular? → Bundle per module

STEP 2: Find Natural Boundaries Look for:

- Directory names indicating modules (auth/, user/, payment/)
- Plugin/theme directories (wp-content/plugins/_, wp-content/themes/_)
- Feature boundaries (admin/, public/, includes/)

STEP 3: Design Bundle Hierarchy

1. Module-specific bundles (most granular)
2. Category bundles (all-tests, all-docs)
3. Aggregated bundles (all-frontend, all-backend)
4. Complete bundle (everything)

📝 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

Example for optimal bundle sizes:

```yaml
# For API documentation (split to stay under 180KB)
api-01-core-options:
  description: "Core API - Options API"
  output: "m1f/api-01-core-options.txt"
  sources:
    - path: "src/api"
      includes: ["options-*.md"]

api-02-core-reactivity:
  description: "Core API - Reactivity system"
  output: "m1f/api-02-core-reactivity.txt"
  sources:
    - path: "src/api"
      includes: ["reactivity-*.md"]

# Quick reference bundle
quick-reference:
  description: "Quick reference and cheat sheet"
  output: "m1f/quick-reference.txt"
  sources:
    - path: "docs"
      includes: ["cheatsheet.md", "quick-*.md"]
    - path: "."
      includes: ["README.md"]

# Common errors bundle
common-errors:
  description: "Common errors and solutions"
  output: "m1f/common-errors.txt"
  sources:
    - path: "docs"
      includes: ["errors/*.md", "troubleshooting.md"]
```

⚡ ACTION PLAN:

1. Read all required files thoroughly
2. VERIFY PATHS: Check project_analysis_dirlist.txt to ensure all paths exist
3. Estimate content sizes and plan bundles based on purpose
4. Design bundles with PRECISE INCLUDES (not broad excludes)
5. Use hierarchical naming (category-number-topic)
6. Create essential bundles (quick-ref, errors, best-practices)
7. Keep focused task bundles under 180KB for Claude Code when practical
8. Add all bundles with MultiEdit in one operation

⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

- Don't use paths like "dot" when you mean "."
- Don't create bundles for non-existent directories
- Don't forget to check if files actually exist in the paths
- Don't use absolute paths like "/home/user/project"
- Don't create bundles smaller than 10KB (they likely have path errors)

Remember: Each bundle should answer "What would I need to understand this
module?" - size appropriately based on the use case!

# HTML2MD Web Scrapers

This module provides a pluggable architecture for web scraping backends in the
HTML2MD tool.

## Architecture

The scraper system is built around:

- `WebScraperBase`: Abstract base class defining the scraper interface
- `ScraperConfig`: Configuration dataclass for all scrapers
- `create_scraper()`: Factory function to instantiate scrapers
- `SCRAPER_REGISTRY`: Registry of available backends

## Available Scrapers

### BeautifulSoup (`beautifulsoup`, `bs4`)

- **Purpose**: General-purpose web scraping for static sites
- **Features**: Async support, encoding detection, metadata extraction
- **Best for**: Most websites without JavaScript requirements

### HTTrack (`httrack`)

- **Purpose**: Complete website mirroring
- **Features**: Professional mirroring, preserves structure
- **Best for**: Creating offline copies of entire websites
- **Requires**: System installation of HTTrack

## Usage

```python
from tools.html2md.scrapers import create_scraper, ScraperConfig

# Configure scraper
config = ScraperConfig(
    max_depth=5,
    max_pages=100,
    request_delay=0.5,
    user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 ..."
)

# Create scraper instance
scraper = create_scraper('beautifulsoup', config)

# Use scraper
async with scraper:
    # Scrape single page
    page = await scraper.scrape_url('https://example.com')

    # Scrape entire site
    async for page in scraper.scrape_site('https://example.com'):
        print(f"Scraped: {page.url}")
```

## Adding New Scrapers

To add a new scraper backend:

1. Create a new file in this directory (e.g., `playwright.py`)
2. Create a class inheriting from `WebScraperBase`
3. Implement required methods:
   - `scrape_url()`: Scrape a single URL
   - `scrape_site()`: Scrape an entire website
4. Register in `__init__.py`:

   ```python
   from .playwright import PlaywrightScraper

   SCRAPER_REGISTRY['playwright'] = PlaywrightScraper
   ```

## Configuration

All scrapers share common configuration options through `ScraperConfig`:

- `max_depth`: Maximum crawl depth
- `max_pages`: Maximum pages to scrape
- `allowed_domains`: List of allowed domains
- `exclude_patterns`: URL patterns to exclude
- `request_delay`: Delay between requests
- `concurrent_requests`: Number of concurrent requests
- `user_agent`: User agent string
- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds

Backend-specific options can be added as needed in the scraper implementation.
