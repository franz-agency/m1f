## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic research with automatic workflow
m1f-research "python async programming"

# Interactive research with URL review
m1f-research "machine learning frameworks" --expand-queries --max-queries 10

# Deep research with crawling
m1f-research "rust web frameworks" --crawl-depth 2 --max-pages-per-site 20

# Generate comparative analysis
m1f-research "cloud providers" --analysis-type comparative

# List all jobs with phase status
m1f-research --list-jobs

# Resume a job from specific phase
m1f-research --resume abc123
```

## Workflow Configuration

Create a `.m1f-research.yml` for custom workflows:

```yaml
workflow:
  expand_queries: true      # Generate search variations
  max_queries: 5           # Number of query variations
  skip_review: false       # Interactive URL review
  crawl_depth: 1          # Follow links one level deep
  max_pages_per_site: 10  # Limit per domain
  generate_analysis: true  # Create AI analysis
  analysis_type: summary   # summary/comparative/technical/trend
```
