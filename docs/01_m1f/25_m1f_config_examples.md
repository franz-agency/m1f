# m1f Configuration Examples

This guide provides comprehensive examples of `.m1f.config.yml` files for
different project types. Each example includes detailed comments explaining the
configuration choices.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: m1f automatically excludes many common directories
> (node_modules, .git, **pycache**, etc.). See the
> [Default Excludes Guide](./26_default_excludes_guide.md) for the complete
> list. **Only add project-specific excludes to keep your configs minimal!**

## üö® IMPORTANT: Use Standard Separator for AI Bundles!

**The primary purpose of m1f bundles is to provide context to AI assistants like
Claude, NOT for human reading in Markdown!**

- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS use**: `separator_style: Standard` (or omit it - Standard is the
  default)
- ‚ùå **AVOID**: `separator_style: Markdown` (this adds unnecessary ```language
  blocks)
- üéØ **Why**: Standard format is clean and optimal for AI consumption

```yaml
# CORRECT - For AI consumption:
bundles:
  - name: my-bundle
    separator_style: Standard  # ‚Üê This is optimal (or just omit it)

# AVOID - Adds unnecessary markdown formatting:
bundles:
  - name: my-bundle
    separator_style: Markdown  # ‚Üê Don't use for AI bundles!
```

**Note**: `MachineReadable` is only needed when you plan to use `s1f` to split
the bundle back into individual files.

## Minimal vs Verbose Configurations

### ‚ùå BAD Example - Overly Verbose (Don't Do This!)

```yaml
global:
  global_excludes:
    # ‚ùå ALL of these are already excluded by default!
    - "**/node_modules/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/vendor/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/__pycache__/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/build/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/dist/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/.git/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/cache/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/.vscode/**" # Auto-excluded
    - "**/.idea/**" # Auto-excluded

    # ‚úÖ Only these are needed (project-specific)
    - "**/logs/**"
    - "**/tmp/**"
    - "/m1f/**"
```

### ‚úÖ GOOD Example - Minimal Configuration

```yaml
global:
  global_excludes:
    # Only project-specific excludes
    - "**/logs/**" # Your log files
    - "**/tmp/**" # Your temp files
    - "/m1f/**" # Output directory

  global_settings:
    # Let .gitignore handle most excludes
    exclude_paths_file: ".gitignore"
```

## Best Practices

When creating your `.m1f.config.yml`:

1. **Group Related Files**: Create focused bundles that group related
   functionality
2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive bundle names that indicate
   content
3. **Set Size Limits**: Keep bundles under 100KB for optimal AI performance
4. **Security First**: Always configure proper security checks for sensitive
   files
5. **Leverage Presets**: Use built-in presets for common project types
6. **Exclude Wisely**: Don't bundle generated files, dependencies, or build
   artifacts
7. **Document Purpose**: Add descriptions to help others understand each bundle
8. **Test Configuration**: Run `m1f-update` and check bundle sizes with
   `m1f-token-counter`

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Separate by Layer

```yaml
bundles:
  frontend: # UI components
  backend: # Server logic
  database: # Models and migrations
  api: # API endpoints
  tests: # Test suites
```

### Pattern 2: Separate by Feature

```yaml
bundles:
  feature-auth: # Authentication
  feature-payment: # Payment processing
  feature-search: # Search functionality
  feature-admin: # Admin panel
```

### Pattern 3: Separate by Purpose

```yaml
bundles:
  quick-reference: # Essential files for context
  documentation: # All docs
  source-code: # Implementation
  configuration: # Config files
  deployment: # Deploy scripts
```

### Pattern 4: Progressive Detail

```yaml
bundles:
  overview: # High-level summary (10KB)
  core-logic: # Main functionality (50KB)
  full-source: # Complete code (100KB)
  everything: # All files (500KB)
```

Remember: The best configuration depends on your specific project needs and how
you plan to use the bundles with AI assistants.
