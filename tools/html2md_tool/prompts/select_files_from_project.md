# Select HTML Files from Project

Use the Glob tool to find all HTML files (*.html and *.htm) in the current directory and subdirectories. Then select exactly 5 representative HTML files from the results.

Look for files with .html or .htm extension. These are scraped documentation pages.

The files should be from different sections/categories to ensure we capture various page layouts and content types.

Important: 
- Return ONLY the file paths, one per line
- Select files with .html or .htm extension only
- Choose files from different directories/sections
- No additional text, explanation, or formatting
