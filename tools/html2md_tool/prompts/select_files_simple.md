# Select Representative HTML Files for Documentation Conversion

## Context
These HTML files were scraped from a documentation website and need to be converted to Markdown format. To determine the best CSS selectors for extracting the main content (while excluding navigation, headers, footers, ads, etc.), we need to analyze a representative sample of files.

## Task
From the scraped documentation files listed below, please select exactly 5 HTML files that would give us the best understanding of the site's structure. Choose files from different sections/categories to ensure we capture various page layouts and content types.

**Important**: Return ONLY the file paths, one per line, with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.
