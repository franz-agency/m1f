# Documentation bundle preset group
# Uses built-in docs_only feature to include all 62 documentation extensions automatically
# Claude prefers valid markdown. However, there are LLMs that only read the first 200 lines of a file and then
# decide whether to continue. This means you need to fit a lot of information into those first 200 lines.
