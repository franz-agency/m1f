# Research Data Directory

This directory contains all data generated by the m1f-research tool, including:

- **Scraped web content** - Raw HTML and converted Markdown files from web
  scraping
- **Research bundles** - Organized collections of research results
- **Metadata** - JSON files with research metadata and statistics
- **Analysis results** - LLM-generated analysis and summaries

## Structure

```
research-data/
├── README.md                 # This file
└── [topic-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]/ # Research sessions
    ├── research-bundle.md    # Main research bundle
    ├── metadata.json         # Research metadata
    ├── search_results.json   # Found URLs
    └── scraped/              # Individual scraped content
        └── [domain]/         # Content organized by domain
```

## Usage

When you run `m1f-research`, the output is automatically saved here unless you
specify a different location with `--output`.

Example:

```bash
m1f-research "python async programming"
# Output saved to: ./research-data/python-async-programming-20240120-143022/
```

## Why This Directory?

- **Persistent Storage**: Research results are saved for future reference
- **Organization**: Each research session gets its own timestamped folder
- **Gitignore**: All contents (except this README) are excluded from version
  control
- **Clean Separation**: Keeps research data separate from source code

## Note

This directory is excluded from git (except this README) because:

- Research data can be large
- Content is user-specific
- Data can be regenerated
- May contain scraped content with various licenses
